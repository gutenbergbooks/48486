<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>By the time this book will appear, nearly six
years will have elapsed since I discovered the
voice of the &#339;sophagus, and almost five since I
published a preliminary account of this discovery
in a book entitled <cite>The Basic Law of Vocal Utterance</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This discovery, though the most comprehensive
and far-reaching of any that has ever been
made, not only in regard to the voice, but in regard
to the better comprehension of our nature and our
entire human existence, has remained as unknown
to the world as if it had never been made. Yet
some day, when its importance is recognized, it
will take rank in the annals of the history of the
human race as second to no other discovery that has
influenced and shaped human thought in the proper
recognition of the origin and the nature of man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>spiritual as well as physical, his abilities and his
limits, and his relative position, influence, and
destiny in the economy of the universe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Edgar S. Werner. New York, 1894.</p></div>

<p>I have spent so many years of arduous labor on
these investigations, and have become so thoroughly
convinced of their truth, that I have ventured
to make these assertions without the slightest
compunction, or fear of final contradiction. Although
the facts involved in these matters entitle
me to these declarations, I would not have overstepped
the bounds of modesty in so far as to make
them had not my first experience forced upon me
the conviction that the path of modesty in matters
of this kind is not the one to success. I was so impressed
with the exalted position of science, and so
apprehensive of my own powers, that in my former
publication I as much as apologized for my temerity
in telling the scientific world things of which it did
not have any previous knowledge. These last four
years, however, have so enlarged my views and
given me such a firm grasp and insight, that I no
longer fear any man's judgment. I would, on the
contrary, heartily welcome honest and competent
criticism, being convinced that the same would not
and could not but strengthen my position.</p>

<p>As a matter of personal gratification, I am indifferent
to success; but I think the time has come
when these matters should not continue to remain
with me alone, but should become the property of
all, not for my sake, nor simply for that of science,
but for the sake of truth, and the benefit of mankind.
Had my previous statements been given the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
consideration they deserved, other persons, in all
probability, would have made <em>some</em> of the many discoveries,
at least, that it has now been my privilege
to make single-handed. Still, the field is inexhaustible;
that which I have discovered being but
an index hand to that which is still to be discovered.
Having no reason to doubt but that I am a properly
organized member of the human family, I consider
myself entitled to speak of my personal experience
as in like manner applicable to every other member
of that family.</p>

<p>Having found it expedient to frequently address
the reader in a "direct" manner, using the personal
pronoun "you" in so doing, I must ask his pardon
for this liberty. In thus addressing him, I trust we
shall be in better rapport; all I shall have to say
thus becoming, in a manner, a confession as from
author to reader. While I confide in him and
make him participate in these vital discoveries, I
want him to confide in me, in so far as to take it
for granted that all I shall say is truthfully meant,
and that it has been arrived at, not superficially,
but only after the most searching and long-continued
investigations. We will thus become partners
in a research as great as any that has ever
agitated man's mind, or filled his soul with things
of great moment. Having penetrated into matters
which have heretofore been considered as occult, or
inaccessible to man, my mode of proceeding will
be found interesting as a guide to others wanting
to pursue similar investigations.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was all brought about by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
simple desire, being a German, to speak the English
language in the precise manner in which native-born
persons speak it. For this purpose, I unwittingly
pursued the same course which has been pursued
by many others under similar circumstances; namely,
that of introspection. Having been indefatigable in
this course (which others must not have been), after
pursuing the same for some time I was startled
by unforeseen discoveries. They were phenomenal,
and far beyond any previous design, hope, or expectation.
After this, my original endeavor to
speak the English language idiomatically correct
became a matter of secondary importance. My
eyes once opened, I <em>continued</em> to persevere in this
course, and thus succeeded in penetrating deeper
and deeper into matters heretofore deemed inaccessible
to man.</p>

<p>Having pursued investigations by means of introspection
now for a number of years, it has become
an easy habit with me, and I can recognize and
pursue processes by which results are obtained
through <em>inner</em> motive powers, almost as plainly as
such by which results are obtained through visible
and tangible means. The facts thus observed and
recognized as truths have become so numerous as to
be almost overwhelming, in number no less than in
importance; so much so, that I scarcely know where
to turn or where to commence, to be able to communicate
them all to others in due form and sequence.
These facts are not temporary, but are
constant; in so far as they can be conjured up at
any time and under any circumstances, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
always of the <em>same</em> nature. They are of an entirely
reasonable, practical, and, for the most part, mechanical
nature; and are explanatory of the exercise
of our faculties and functions, spiritually as well as
materially. That these observations mirror actual
proceedings going on within us for the production
of vocal utterance, of breathing, motion, and locomotion,
and the exercise of various other faculties and
functions, it will be my endeavor, by actual demonstration,
to prove through this and future publications.</p>

<p>For the purpose of enabling others to pursue a
similar course of studies, I shall take especial pains
to point out my course of proceeding as plainly as I
can&mdash;such course with me having been entirely rational,
positive, and direct, and without in any sense
disturbing my ordinary mode of existence. The
course pursued in physiologico-psychological studies,
in fact, does not differ greatly from that pursued
in the study of purely psychological subjects, which
is also carried on by means of introspection, though
it is of a more positive nature.</p>

<p>When the following was first written (it is nearly
two years ago now), I intended, at an early date, to
publish a short treatise on the subject of the voice
only. Since then, however, the same has assumed
greater and greater proportions, embracing many
other subjects. Still I have deemed it best not to
change this introduction in consequence thereof.</p>

<p>Though not quite ready for another publication
(the subject is so great and my knowledge so inadequate),
I do not know that I should have <em>ever</em> been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<em>quite</em> ready, but for several incidents, all happening
about the same time, which have induced me to
break the silence I have observed since the publication
of my book, <cite>The Basic Law of Vocal Utterance</cite>.
These incidents, though in themselves apparently
insignificant, have impressed me with the belief that
I owe it to the public and myself to say something
in explanation of what I have already said, and to
add thereto (partly, at least) what has since been
ascertained.</p>

<p>In the November, 1896, number of <cite>Werner's
Magazine</cite>, I noticed the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A good example of the inadequacy of expressional
terms in discussing vocal topics is shown by Mme. Clara
Brinkerhoff and Mr. Emil Sutro. Mme. Brinkerhoff has
been a contributor to this magazine, and has addressed
musical bodies, for many years. Mr. Sutro is author of
the book, <cite>The Basic Law of Vocal Utterance</cite>. Both of
them maintain that the voice is something more or other
than an expiratory current of air set into vibration by
purely physical agencies. Mme. Brinkerhoff thinks that
the voice is the utterance of the soul, and that the soul
has its seat in the solar plexus. Mr. Sutro scoffs at the
theory that the voice is only out-coming air vibrated at
or by the cords situated in the larynx. He thinks that
the ligaments under the tongue also serve as vocal cords,
and that speech is the product of vibrating ingoing air
as well as vibrating out-coming air. Just what they
think the voice is neither of these persons makes clear to
others. Their failure to express their thoughts, however,
should not be taken as proof that they have not caught
glimpses of truths of the greatest importance. Still, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
impression is that their concepts are too vague to be put
into intelligible language even if the expressional terms
at hand were adequate. But, all things considered, the
fact still remains that discussion will continue to be
largely useless so long as one person does not know what
the other person is talking about."</p></div>

<p>In addition to all this, the proceedings of various
societies in New York alone, judging by their reports
also contained in the November, 1896, number
of <cite>Werner's Magazine</cite>, which is of unusual
interest throughout, show how great is the interest
which, at the present time, centres around this matter
of the voice. In place of saying the "truth" in
matters of the voice, as contained in my book, it
would, perhaps, be more correct to have said, "the
first ray of light that has ever penetrated the gloom
and the mystery surrounding the nature of the
voice." In <cite>Werner's Magazine</cite> it is stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If Mr. Emil Sutro's book, <cite>The Basic Law of Vocal
Utterance</cite>, be right, then other writers on vocal science
are wrong. His statements are startling and revolutionary.
He claims to have discovered a new vocal cord
and to be able to prove that speech sounds are the product
of inspiration as well as expiration. The significance
of this is apparent when it is realized that all vocal
authorities, heretofore, have taught that voice is vocalized
expiration, and that speech is this vocalized expiration
articulated into words.</p>

<p>"The author draws a sharp distinction between the air
taken for life-purposes and the air taken for speech-purposes.
He says that vital breathing can and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
go on independent of artistic breathing, and that the two
processes need not and should not disturb nor conflict
with one another. He combats the theory that the lungs
are a reservoir of air, which in the vocal act is pressed
against the vocal cords of the larynx, thereby producing
tone, which is resonated and modified by the parts above
the glottis. He maintains that it is a physical impossibility
to give sufficient force and rapidity to the lung air
to put muscular and cartilaginous tissue into tonal
vibration,&mdash;that this force and this rapidity can come
only from the internal atmospheric pressure, and that,
therefore, preparatory lung inhalation for voice-purposes
obstructs rather than aids the vocal act. He gives a new
explanation of the formation of speech sounds, and offers
various novel theories.</p>

<p>"Many readers will hesitate to accept his views, yet as
long as vocal science is still in a formative condition and
involved in so much chaos and uncertainty, any attempt
at a solution should receive careful consideration."</p></div>

<p>I have cited this able review in full, written by
one whose life has been one act of devotion to the
solution of these questions, as it will at once introduce
the reader into the drift of my investigations
as far as they had advanced up to that time.</p>

<p>I have continued to steadily devote myself to the
further prosecution of my investigations, never publishing
anything, scarcely ever speaking on this subject
to any one. The subject appeared to me so great
and so far above my ability to master it that I, at
first, looked around for assistance among those I
deemed most likely to be able to render it. But no
one had any assistance to offer, no one scarcely seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
even to comprehend what I was after. Thus, at last,
almost in despair, I made up my mind that I must
undertake this task single-handed; and I have been
at it, scarcely without interruption, ever since.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the play of "Much Ado about Nothing,"
or "The Farce about the Larynx," continued
to go on bravely all over the world. I have
watched it with a sense of pity, rather than amusement.
It appeared to me, more than anything else,
like a game of blind man's buff, in which <em>all</em> the
participants were blindfolded; my own horizon,
meanwhile, being illumined by roseate tints representing
continuous new discoveries, like a May
morn before the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>The voice has been treated as a separate mechanical
issue, while it is the outcome of a series of both
physical and spiritual issues. While the old school
is reproducing, in its minutest details, the <em>dead</em>
branch of a tree, I am portraying, in its majestic
proportions, the broad expanse of a <em>living</em> oak.</p>

<p>These anatomical details may interest scientists;
they are valueless to the singer, as he has no control
over the movements of the larynx. He need but
"attack" his note in the right way, and all these
muscles, sinews, cartilaginous tissues, etc., will fall
into line, involuntarily and unsolicited.</p>

<p>Now that I am offering innumerable <em>proofs</em> in corroboration
of my assertions, I want scientists to
take these matters <em>seriously</em>, and not to look upon
this book, also, as some may possibly have felt inclined
to do in regard to my previous publication,
as a "scientific curiosity" merely. There are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
greater problems before the world to-day than are
treated here.</p>

<p>During all these years of unrequited labor, which
extend far beyond the day on which I made my
memorable discovery, my personal affairs meanwhile
constantly suffering, with but one notable exception
<em>no</em> hand was held out to me in succor. In view of
this fact (and it is the experience of many who, in
the privacy of their souls, are struggling after the
light), I want to ask this question: With all the
noble institutions for <em>learning</em>, why are there none
to assist those who are attempting to solve questions
<em>to be taught</em> for the benefit and advancement
of mankind? True, there are scholarships and fellowships
for students, but they are not available to
persons advanced in years who have duties to perform
and families to support. When successful in
the end, their reward&mdash;if there is any&mdash;often comes
too late to be of any practical value.</p>

<p>Such would be the case with me should any material
acknowledgment come to me now, having of
late attained to the leisure I had so much longed for,
thanks to my previous labor and a brave son's devotion
and valued aid and assistance. No man,
however, will ever know how long I have been kept
under the ban of purely materialistic endeavors,
while these higher things were occupying my mind
and clamoring for recognition. A sum equal to
that representing a single day's expenditure for
<em>falsely</em> teaching matters connected with the voice,
alone, the world over, not to speak of other matters
of still greater importance, would have sufficed for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
number of years, if not for a lifetime, to place me in
a position to devote myself exclusively to the exposition
of the correct principles underlying these
important subjects. As it has been with me, no
doubt it is and always has been with many others
in different fields of research.</p>

<p>Since the publication of my previous book, I
have had four years of continuous experience, during
which the statements therein made have been
strengthened and enlarged, so that I am now ready
to support them with an endless array of proof.
That book, however, was the beginning of what
some day will be regarded as a greater movement in
the right direction than any previous one, for attaining
an insight into nature's occult work in creating,
developing, and sustaining the living organism, and
the exercise of its faculties and functions, more
especially <em>man's</em> faculties and functions. The subject,
however, is of so subtle a nature that it cannot
be treated like a mathematical problem or a chemical
analysis; still, I shall do the best I can with such
means as are at my command.</p>

<p>Recently an acquaintance who is interested in
vocal culture asked me how I was getting along, and
I answered, telling him something like what I have
said in the preceding. He replied:</p>

<p>"That is the trouble with you Germans. This is
a live world, a practical world; we want facts, results&mdash;something
we can turn to account and make use
of."</p>

<p>This impatience (and who can blame those who are
suffering, or those who, being young and talented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
want to be led into the right path) throws the
door wide open to all kinds of charlatanism&mdash;charlatanism
which is honest and charlatanism which is
dishonest, the former, being more readily trusted,
often working the greater harm. The best teaching
for the present, in default of a science, is that
which is based simply on experience; the pseudo-science
now being taught being worse than no science
at all.</p>

<p>While the exercise of speech is next to universal
with all men, no one has any idea of <em>how</em> it is exercised;
the wisest being as much in the dark as the
least informed.</p>

<p>This is what so eminent a man as Oliver Wendell
Holmes had to say on the subject in one of his lectures,
delivered not many years before his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Talking has been clearly explained and successfully
imitated by artificial contrivances. We know that the
moist membranous edges of a narrow crevice (the
glottis) vibrate as the reed of a clarionet vibrates, and
thus produce the human <em>bleat</em>. We narrow or widen, or
check or stop the flow of this sound by the lips, the
tongue, the teeth, and thus <em>articulate</em>, or break into joints,
the even current of sound. The sound varies with the
degree and kind of interruption, as the 'babble' of the
brook with the shape and size of its impediments&mdash;pebbles,
or rocks, or dams. To whisper, is to articulate
without <em>bleating</em>, or vocalizing; to <em>coo</em>, as babies do, is to
<em>bleat</em>, or vocalize, without articulating. Machines are
easily made that bleat not unlike human beings. A bit
of India-rubber tube tied around a piece of glass tube, is
one of the simplest voice-uttering contrivances. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
make a machine that articulates, is not so easy." [The
Italics are Dr. Holmes's.]</p></div>

<p>It is not the <em>humorist</em> Holmes, however, who has
said this, as one would suppose that it was, but it
is the writer, scientist, and thinker, who was in dead
earnest when he gave unto the world this "definition
of the gift of speech."</p>

<p>Any comment on my part would but weaken the
sense of the ludicrous this "explanation" of so
great a subject, even from a mere mechanical standpoint,
must arouse in the reader. Yet Dr. Holmes's
"explanation" is not any more preposterous than
that of many other scientists of the present day.</p>

<p>Teachers have said that, not being a teacher, I
could not know anything about the voice. As if
<em>they</em> had the sole patent right to the voice, and
others held their voices but from them, in fee! I,
however, took the liberty of looking into my own
voice and trying to find out whence it came and
what it was made of. It is not much of a voice, to
be sure; yet it has the common attributes of all
voices. Besides, I should like to know who, in
truth, <em>is</em> a teacher. He who over a narrow path
follows the footsteps of others, or he who strikes
out boldly for the root and the truth of a matter,
and, disregarding precedents, goes down to the very
bowels of the earth, if need be, to bring it to the
surface?</p>

<p>The knowledge of even the best of us is not much
more than some froth on the surface of the well of
truth. Yet that froth is all these timid souls have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dared to examine. They have not had the courage
to dive down deep into its fathomless flood. Many
a truth has been taught by those who had been considered
innocent of any knowledge thereof. I am
one of these "innocents," and, on the whole, am
not sorry for not having been imbued more with the
knowledge, or supposed knowledge, of the present
day.</p>

<p>We are so much the slaves of habit that we become
reconciled to any condition, almost, no matter
how undesirable or absurd it may be. Thus biological
science has been going along in a rut for
centuries, but little having been ascertained of vital
importance; nor could this have been otherwise,
considering the modes of investigation. I was not
surrounded by so many trees that I could not see
the woods. My perspective was as clear as a bird's,
that soars above and beyond the smoke of the city
and the dust in the eyes of the heirs of generation
upon generation of anatomical and physiological
research, burying beneath its lumber the clear insight
of the soul. Thus, ignorance with me may
indeed have been bliss. Yet I do not want to
place myself in a position as deprecating science,
having the highest appreciation for all its endeavors.
I deprecate science only in so far as, dealing with
matter, it attempts to draw inspiration therefrom
as to spiritual issues; and the voice certainly is a
spiritual issue.</p>

<p>The following appears in the <cite>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</cite>,
under the heading of "Animal Magnetism":</p>

<p>"Mr. Heidenhain, after stating that in conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with the manner in which one muscle is affected,
others become similarly affected, proceeds to say:
'Probably the reflex excitement would extend still
farther, but I naturally consider it out of the question
to try whether the muscles of respiration would
become affected. It is easily understood that such
experiments require the greatest caution and may
be very seldom carried out.'"</p>

<p>Valiant Mr. Heidenhain, brave explorer on a new
and "dangerous" field of research. This is the
<em>Ultima Thule</em> which any of these bold adventurers
have endeavored to reach. <em>My work began where
theirs came to an end.</em> Though I have not reached
the "North Pole," I have gone far beyond anyone
else.</p>


<h3>COMMENTS OF A DISTANT REVIEWER</h3>

<p>This entire subject is of so subtle a nature that I
must warn the reader to be patient in its study and
careful of his judgment. Should the present work,
however, also fail to elicit the attention of my fellowmen,
some thinker, perhaps, of a future generation,
upon discovering a copy of this book on the dusty
shelves of an antiquarian, while looking over its
time-stained leaves and after struggling with its vernacular,
may be struck with some remark coinciding
with ideas arrived at by himself and other scientists
of that day, and while commenting upon his "find,"
may possibly deliver himself thus:</p>

<p>"As the nineteenth century of the Christian era
was drawing to a close, a citizen of the (then) youthful
country of the United States of North America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
published a book which contained disclosures far
in advance of his time and generation&mdash;truths, in
fact, concerning life and the exercise of our faculties
and functions, which, if properly understood, might
have eventually led to even the solution of the very
mystery of the soul. Though science at that remote
period had made marvellous strides forward, its endeavors
were mostly of a utilitarian character, or
consisted of efforts to explain phenomena from a
strictly materialistic standpoint. The author of this
book, however, by dint of a combination of extraordinary
circumstances, which induced him to search
for causes of phenomena within, in place of outside
of himself, had succeeded in breaking through the
barriers which had, theretofore, separated phenomena
which were called 'natural' from those which,
by the majority of mankind, were still supposed to
be 'supernatural,' or, at least, unexplainable, unknowable,
beyond the ken of man.</p>

<p>"He was thus enabled to penetrate more deeply
than any one ever had before into the knowledge of
the mysterious forces which engender and sustain
organic life. Had he been properly understood, the
compass of human knowledge would have been
greatly enhanced, and the race itself liberated from
the narrow limits to which it had been confined by
the scientists almost as much as by the theologians
(by the doctors of the body almost as much as by
those of the soul) of his day. Some writers of that
period delighted in depicting a state of affairs several
centuries ahead of their time. The changes which
were supposed to have taken place, however, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reference to material developments only, and did
not contemplate any advancement of a purely spiritual
nature.</p>

<p>"Though the founder of the Christian religion,
and other men of a high order of intellectual and
moral insight, had laid down rules for 'deportment'
which to a great extent still govern the world; in
regard to a spiritual insight, the dearth, the waste,
the discord, the distraction, the unrest, the 'Weltschmerz'
(as the Germans called it), the despair of
science, which knew but and dealt but with the
baser part of our existence, unable to penetrate into
the higher, was then at its height. The 'miracle'
had ceased to exercise its influence over the intellectual
classes, and knowledge had not taken its place.</p>

<p>"This writer, however, through his discoveries,
had opened up the way&mdash;made a beginning&mdash;to a
penetration of science into the realms of the spirit;
and a substitution of faith based on <em>facts</em> for one
based on tradition and fancy only. Religion and
science, having been factors of a different, almost
antagonistic, order, thus at that early period already
might have become reconciled and united through
<em>knowledge</em>; as to some extent, though by different
means, they have become since.</p>

<p>"In thus gaining more knowledge, more light regarding
the motive powers which govern our existence,
the shackles which had overwhelmed the soul
would have long since fallen to the ground, and a
<em>truly</em> brotherly spirit would have prevailed among
all classes and peoples in place of much of the prejudice,
the insincerity, the overbearance, the ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>mosity,
the cruelty, and the insanity even of the
believers in (or inheritors of) one spiritual theory
(often misnamed religion) as against those of another.</p>

<p>"The world's thought, just previous to that time,
had made great strides forward through the recognition
of the laws of <em>evolution</em>, which culminated in
one master mind, through great elaboration and by
citing numerous examples, assigning cogent and
necessary reasons therefor. The world should have
been ripe, therefore, for this <em>greater movement</em> which
it was now called upon to face; a movement which
went beyond the mere recognition of phenomena
and penetrated into <em>a priori</em> causes. Strange to say,
it either could not or would not understand; being
still bound by fetters which held it in a vise-like
embrace of previously conceived ideas as to the impossibility
of penetrating into matters of this nature,
and which prevented it from even <em>testing</em> the numerous
proofs offered by this writer as to the correctness
of his assertions. His investigations, if properly
understood, would have brought spirituality <em>home</em> to
us; they would have made it accessible to us. It
would have ceased to be a phantom, and would have
become a reality, a friend on whom we could count,
in place of a mysterious and incomprehensible
stranger.</p>

<p>"Beginning with discovering the dual nature of
the voice, the writer of this book opened up the way
to the comprehension of the mystery of man's dual
nature in <em>all</em> its relations. He made the discovery
that the &#339;sophagus is of equal importance with the
trachea in carrying on the process of respiration and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in exercising the faculty of vocal expression; that
for these purposes &#339;sophagus and trachea are to an
equal degree directly amenable to the influence of
the atmospheric air; that the dual nature of organic
beings in general, and of man in particular, is represented
by the hemispheres of the thorax and the
abdomen; that the former in its entirety represents
spiritual and the latter in its entirety material issues;
that the trachea and its branches on the one hand,
and the alimentary canal on the other, respectively
represent these issues more directly; that the fusing
and blending of these issues has for its result the
phenomenon called life; that the severance of these
issues has for its result the phenomenon called death;
that there are thus positive limits, place, and surroundings
assigned to material and immaterial issues
within the sphere of our bodily existence, and that
combined they pervade our entire system; that all
phenomena of life, especially all phenomena of a
spiritual nature, and among these more ostensibly
those of vocal utterance, owe their origin to these
issues momentarily joining hands; that in so doing
there is a transitory fusion, which for an endless
number of purposes is brought about in an endless
number of ways.</p>

<p>"He discovered further that the larynx, previously
supposed to be the <em>only</em> instrument for the production
of sounds, has its counterpart in the
'replica' (the 'larynx' of the &#339;sophagus), located
beneath the tongue and represented by the fr&aelig;num
lingu&aelig; and surrounding cartilaginous tissues; that
no vocal sound can be produced except by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>co&ouml;peration
of the larynx with the replica. He discovered
the circulation of, and the origin of vocal
sounds, and many other important issues.</p>

<p>"Through his discoveries, if properly recognized,
<em>all</em> the sciences dealing with life would have been
placed upon a new and far more reasonable and
comprehensible basis than they had rested upon
before.</p>

<p>"These discoveries would have tended to undermine
the basis of every materialistic school of philosophy,
and to place those with spiritual and ideal
propensities upon higher and firmer ground. Had
they been properly appreciated and further expanded
by others it would have eventually become
possible to develop <em>all</em> our faculties to the
full extent of their ability, and to correct faults,
errors, and defects caused by wrong education or
heredity, through the application of laws at the
very root of our existence; laws which were then,
and in fact to a great extent are to this day unknown.</p>

<p>"It may, in fact, be said without exaggeration
that his discoveries, which were all made within a
period not exceeding five years, outweighed in importance
all other discoveries combined relating to
physiologico-psychical issues made previous to his
time."</p>

<p>I can see many a reader smile after perusing the
foregoing, and perhaps saying:</p>

<p>"Here is a Jules Verne of a new type come
to deal with a novel subject."</p>

<p>Yet the time will come when the reader will cease
to smile, and look upon these matters <em>seriously</em>. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
do not mean, however, to throw down a gauntlet to
science on these momentous questions in <em>a vaunting
and reckless spirit</em>; but come as a petitioner rather,
asking it to investigate.</p>

<p>My time and generation are but like a flash from
the orb of eternity, but the laws I have discovered
are as eternal as that orb itself. With all the scientific
investigations now going on, there has not even
an approach been made which might have led up to
them; nay, not a hint or a hypothesis, even, leading
toward the same. Science, in fact, had nothing to
do with them; the first man might have made them
almost as well as the latest. They are all grappling
with matter, while I have grasped the spirit that is
in, yet above, all living matter.</p>

<p>In making these discoveries I have bent a sail
upon the crafts of physiology and psychology, which
have been aimlessly, almost hopelessly, drifting on
the shallow waters of the examination of isolated
material phenomena. This sail will enable them to
reach the broad expanse of the ocean, where they
will be able to make soundings in its deepest waters.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley declared that during his fifty
years of experience as a student and teacher not one
thing really <em>new</em> had ever come under his observation.
Had he lived to become acquainted with these
facts I feel confident he would have declared them
to be new.</p>

<p>The venerable Professor Virchow, the other day,
in an address before the International Congress of
Physicians at Moscow, made use, in substance, of
these words: "The cell is immortal&mdash;there must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
have been a previous cell for its generation. On
this fact as a basis (ascertained by the aid of the
microscope) the science of the coming century may
securely rest."</p>

<p>And he set this down as the greatest achievement
of science in respect to the recognition of the phenomena
of life. Yet there is nothing more fallible
than the microscope in ascertaining facts regarding
the knowledge of life. It may to some extent reveal
the essence of <em>matter</em>, but it is not given to it
to assist in recognizing the principles which govern
life and the <em>spirit</em> of life.</p>


<h3>FRAGMENTS</h3>

<p>This book, in a sense, is a personal narrative, and
necessarily must be so, giving an account, as it
does, of observations in experiments upon myself.
In making these experiments I have endeavored to
treat myself impersonally, as a subject, so to say,
placed at my disposal for experimental purposes;
my ego having been the object as well as the subject
of my investigations. In occasionally speaking of
the results thus obtained in a eulogistic manner, this
should not be looked upon as self-praise, therefore,
but rather as an impersonal mode of describing what
has come under some one's observation&mdash;this "some
one" being myself. I want to place the matters I
have observed before the reader in the right light,
and do not hesitate to say or fear to say just what I
think to be the truth. If I were to wait for others
to say these things the reader who does not comprehend
their latitude as I do might have to wait a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
time before he could grasp the subject in its entire
importance. I want to say this much as an apology
and a vindication for frequent indulgences in apparent
self-eulogism.</p>

<p>I have another motive for making such remarks;
viz., the desire of rousing the scientific world from
its apathy regarding these matters. These laudatory
remarks may wound its pride, and possibly arouse
its ire,&mdash;more especially in view of their coming from
a layman,&mdash;and thus induce it to study these matters,
if but for the purpose and with the view of
controverting them. I would hail such an endeavor
with pleasure, not having the slightest fear of its
ability to successfully controvert any of the vital
facts I have ascertained, and whose correctness I expect
to prove by a great array of facts with accompanying
proofs.</p>

<p>When I first began to make these studies, I made
numerous notes as new features happened to present
themselves to my mind. I have encountered no inconsiderable
difficulty in sifting this material so as
to present my experiences in as connected and consecutive
a manner as possible. In this, however, I
have only partially succeeded; nor have I been able
to altogether avoid repetitions. For these shortcomings
I must plead a want of time. For some
time past, however, my experiences have accumulated
so rapidly that I have ceased to take any notes
whatever, trusting to my memory that these mental
notes may be recalled at the proper time. No doubt
some things, even of importance, have thus been
lost sight of. Still, while pursuing similar studies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they may in the course of time turn up in some one
else's mind.</p>

<p>In looking over some of my notes I have found
things which I have deemed worthy of preservation.
I let some of these follow in a promiscuous manner.
This, it must be admitted, is not in accordance with
scientific usage. But I am not a scientist, simply
an amateur; and take advantage of the privileges
this fact gives me. If I were to conform to strict
scientific rules and "etiquette," years might elapse
before I could get these matters into proper shape.
It will always remain a mystery to me, however,
why these things should have come to me at all&mdash;so
unworthy, so unadapted to their proper exposition.
In order to do them justice, they should have come
to one complete master of his time, young, strong,
possessed of a wide range of knowledge and a deep
insight.</p>

<p>I will now let follow some of the matters I have
spoken of:</p>

<p>My personality and my work must go together,
until others relieve me of the latter by making it
<em>their</em> work to the same extent that I have made it
mine. You cannot separate the fiddle from the
fiddler, neither having any significance apart from
each other, except by the fiddler perpetuating that
which the fiddle produces&mdash;the composition,&mdash;by
writing it down, thus transmitting it to others.
This I am trying to do by this book.</p>

<p>No doubt some of the things which have come
under my observation in some form or other are
already known to science, and are, therefore, a cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>roboration,
or an explanation, only, of things already
known. With me, nevertheless, <em>all</em> is original; and
I may therefore justly claim that if any of these
matters have been discovered before, I, at least, have
<em>re-discovered</em> them.</p>

<p>If I were an institution possessing a guaranty of
continued existence I might value the present lightly,
knowing a future would come when these matters will
be fully understood. Being a creature of the present,
however, which may be turned into the past&mdash;especially
at my time of life&mdash;at almost any moment,
these matters should become known at the earliest
opportunity; some of them being of so subtle a
nature that they may require personal explanation
and illustration. They have been hidden from us in
the past; should they fail to be made known now,
<em>the same opportunity may not arise again for centuries</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not claim any special sagacity over others for
having made these discoveries, and disbelieve altogether
in miraculous interposition. Yet I do not
want to be prejudiced in any direction.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by the mysterious and the
miraculous; and that which is called "natural" as
a rule is far more mysterious than that which is
called "miraculous."</p>

<p>"Truth is stranger than fiction"; which is undoubtedly
true. We can imagine that only of which
we have at least <em>some</em> knowledge, but there are realms
of truth beyond us of which we have <em>no</em> knowledge.
Besides, these revelations are of so extraordinary a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
nature that I cannot altogether close my eyes to the
fact that I <em>may have been led on to them</em> by agencies
beyond my personal power of volition. I will cite
but one reason why such an idea might be justly
entertained by me.</p>

<p>That which originally led me on to these investigations,
as already mentioned, was the simple desire
to speak the English language just as native-born
persons speak it. Although I eventually became
aware of the fact that this was next to impossible,
yet I persisted in this endeavor to such an extent
that I spent far more time on it than it would have
deserved had I been <em>convinced</em> that I would be finally
successful. Again and again I said to myself, "This
is a foolish, absurd, unworthy undertaking for a
person of intelligence"; the next minute I was at
it again, trying to utter this sound or pronounce
that word in the "correct English fashion."</p>

<p>I want to ask, What was it that impelled me to
thus persist, almost against my wish, will, and better
insight? When, after many years of this almost
wanton endeavor, I discovered the dual nature of
the voice, I could not help but think that an influence
beyond myself had been exercised to impel me
to persist in these efforts, which were then crowned
with a success of a different order, and far beyond
any previous expectation. <em>I then found what I had
been after unknown to myself.</em> To simply say I was
"infatuated" would not explain this strange adherence
to what for a long while looked like a vain
and hopeless undertaking.</p>

<p>I am aware that for me to say, as I have just now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
said, "I cannot altogether close my eyes to the fact
that I may have been led on by agencies beyond my
personal power of volition," may expose me to ridicule
in the eyes of some persons; besides being a
contradiction to my other convictions. Yet I say so
deliberately and am quite willing to abide by the
consequences. It is a case of the duality of our
nature, which impels me to take a naturalistic or
biogenetic view of things in one direction, yet forces
me to take a spiritualistic or abiogenetic view of
them in another direction. I do not comprehend
those who under <em>all circumstances</em> are capable of
pursuing either the one direction or the other.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I might say I have been on a prospecting tour to a
<em>new</em> country, where I found the outcroppings of
numerous veins of precious ore. These veins are
<em>true fissure veins</em>, penetrating, as they do, into the
very bowels of the earth; and it will take centuries
to exhaust them in all their <em>dips, spurs, and angles</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be a matter of surprise that a layman, one
not of the tribe which make science the pursuit of
their lives, should have penetrated into these mysteries.
It must not be lost sight of, however, that
science, as a rule, deals with things visible and
tangible, while the voice is a sensation which, regarding
its origin in the ego, cannot be observed
outside of the ego. One may by close observation
trace the origin of one's voice to its innermost channels,
and thus learn much about the subtlest characteristics
of its nature, a proceeding to which it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
not be possible to subject any one else's voice.
The same conditions prevail in regard to other sensations
which have also come under my, at least,
partial observation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Science, as a rule, has been satisfied with the observation
of results, of phenomena, without attempting
to penetrate into causes, which seemed to be
unalterably hidden from its gaze. Special features,
however, of the voice have been ably and successfully
observed and described by many eminent persons.
To these I have not given any attention,
partly because they were beyond my sphere, and
partly (not being a musician) because they were beyond
my power of observation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In looking for the voice, anatomy in its minute
examinations of the larynx has but opened up a
grave for us to gaze into. And what have we beheld?
A skeleton of the voice's body&mdash;of its soul
not a trace. This skeleton, to boot, is but a <em>portion</em>
of the mechanism of the voice; of its other parts,
equally important, science has not even known that
they were in existence. Like a pal&aelig;ontologist or
an arch&aelig;ologist, I have dug up these other parts or
fragments from all around; some were found close
at hand, others quite a distance off. I have skilfully
put them together, and have thus constructed a
fairly <em>complete</em> torso, or framework of the voice. I
say "torso," though I may justly claim more than
that, having again infused the soul into it which had
fled from it; and, see, it has become a <em>living thing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>That the wonderful apparatus contained in the
throat is for a purpose there cannot, of course, be
any doubt. It is but partly for the purpose attributed
to it, however, and, until we better comprehend
this part-purpose, especially in view of the fact
<em>that we have no control over its mechanism</em>, it will be
best, as far as singers and elocutionists are concerned,
to surrender it to and leave it with the anatomists.</p>

<p>To the ultimate aim of science&mdash;the knowledge of
life&mdash;I have contributed matters of a nature deemed
beyond the province of the knowledge of man.
Was it ever intended that they should be known?
On more than one occasion I have been puzzled to
know whether to go on with these investigations;
whether I had a <em>right</em> to go on with them. Still, I
was sustained by the fact that I had been <em>led on to
them</em>. For what other purpose could this have been
done but for that of making the results thereof
known? They could serve no good purpose in
remaining locked up <em>within myself</em>.</p>

<p>It is my belief that the ordinary course of events
is never interfered with; but that <em>great</em> events may
be inaugurated by unseen agencies and guided by
unseen hands. The responsibility which has devolved
upon me, incompetent and unprepared as I
am, is almost too great; still, I must try to discharge
it to the best of my ability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have no personal motive of either fame or fortune.
At one time I would have been pleased with
such results; now it is too late. If not in my day,
some day, I trust, some one will read and compre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>hend;
some one will not mind the trouble of investigation.
It is not likely that I shall <em>forever</em> remain
the only "seeing one."</p>

<p>It would have been better if I had not published
a line for at least ten years. It would have taken
that long to say what I want to say, <em>properly</em>. My
time is too uncertain, however, to run such a risk.
My friends are falling to the right and left by the
roadside. I must be up and doing; must make a
beginning at least.</p>

<p>We must be satisfied with reaching matters approximately,
and argue by analogy to some extent;
and also hope that others will take them up and
push them along a little farther than we have been
able to do. Perhaps in the course of time a perfect
insight may be arrived at.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The community of man is a necessity; a separate
existence, an anomaly. We are dependent and interdependent
upon one another. Man cannot escape
his fellow-man. In the remotest desert his
spirit is still in communication with him. If it were
not so, who would not at times want to flee all,
escape from all?</p>

<p>I have but one fear&mdash;inability, for some reason or
other, to finish my work. I feel like the heroine of
a celebrated German novelist, travelling about with
a trunk filled with gold, which she distributed among
the <em>deserving poor</em> as fast as she came across them.
Meanwhile she was in constant fear lest her life
should ebb out before all was distributed, and its
precious contents <em>lost</em> to those for whom they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
intended. If there were any way of imparting this
knowledge other than by writing it down, I would
gladly resort to it. But how can I reach the few
who are capable of and willing to take up these
questions, except by communicating them to the
many? These "few" will be found in all parts of
the world, for these truths apply to <em>all</em> men, independent
of sex, race, or country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My cry is not for recognition. My personality
might be blotted out, like that of millions of others,
without its being noticed, yet, by virtue of this trust
which has been reposed in me, what a loss it would
be! My cry is for investigation and the co&ouml;peration
of others, so that this work may be carried on independent
of myself. Meantime, I cannot transfer
this task to others. I must first explain all that it
is in my power to explain. I can then shift it from
my shoulders onto theirs. They must be educated
up to it before they can take hold of it as I have
taken hold of it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I first announced my discoveries, I gave all
I possessed, supposing others would see as I saw
and comprehend as I did; having no doubt but that
the world would at once acknowledge their truths and
accept their precepts. I have since found that the
world can get along very comfortably with a vast
amount of want of knowledge. I therefore made
up my mind not to be quite so rash again in making
it my beneficiary, not till I was better prepared for
the purpose; this other book of mine having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
finished rather hastily in the erroneous belief that
this knowledge was at once and imperatively needed.</p>

<p>Since publishing this previous book I have also
found, which I did not know at that time, that my
very mode of investigation (by means of introspection)
was new; that no one had ever looked into
matters of this kind in the manner I had; besides,
it seems strange that in this age of keen investigation
of the most trivial matters, no one should
have deemed it worth his while to look into these
more important subjects.</p>

<p>Regarding the anatomical investigations of the
larynx, and anatomical, coupled with physiological,
investigations generally, let me ask a question: Supposing
a palace with a million apartments, each one
in succession more luxuriously furnished than its
predecessor, would they avail anything to its <em>sole</em>
inhabitant, if that inhabitant were blind?</p>

<p>We have obtained a fair conception of the wonderful
palace, the human body, its numberless apartments
and their luxurious furnishings, but do not
comprehend their meaning, except in a remote and
unsatisfactory mechanical sense. <em>We</em> are the blind
that inhabit it. Most of these apartments will remain
meaningless to our understanding until we
ascertain what use the sovereign, the soul, which
reigns therein, is making of them, not only mechanically,
but <em>spiritually</em> as well. For the soul lives in
them all, though it is supposed that it lives only
in its throne-room of the brain and that it never
descends from the throne set up in the same.</p>

<p>Just here biologists have blundered, trying to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hold of <em>psyche</em> by pursuing matter bereft of life; or
investigating life in other beings instead of that
inherent in themselves. The vivisection of all the
frogs in the world will not give us the first knowledge
of the frog's soul; certainly not of <em>our</em> soul.
The knowledge of the anatomical construction of
the larynx has brought us no nearer the knowledge
of the mystery of the voice than that of the brain
has brought us to that of the soul. We must understand
the process by which the mechanism of the
brain is set in <em>motion</em> before we can begin to understand
our mode of thinking. We must comprehend
the manner in which a musical instrument is to be
used before we can begin to draw music from the
same. And so must we understand the spirit which
moves the mechanism of the voice (of which so far
we have known but a single factor), if we want to
understand our mode of using it.</p>

<p>Does any one seriously think that by photographing
vocal sounds, or passing a mirror down his throat
and watching the movements of the vocal cords,
he will observe anything that will lead him to an intimate
knowledge of nature's subtle process by which
vocal sounds are produced? As well look at the
face of a clock and see its hands move, and then say
you have arrived at a knowledge of the hidden intricate
mechanism of the works of the clock. The
mechanism of the instrument of the voice is a thousand
times more intricate than that of a clock. It
lives, it breathes, it moves, it expands and contracts,
it rises and falls, it gathers, it gives&mdash;now here, now
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Starting from the supposition that life is too subtle,
too intangible a thing to have its innermost operations
disclosed by the clumsy work of our hands or
the dull vision of our eyes, though increased in
power a thousandfold, I matched the subtle work
of my voice with the subtler of my brain, and thus,
undisturbed by any extraneous agency whatever,
watched the process by which, first, simple mechanical,
then articulated sounds, and finally sounds
linked together into speech, are produced. In so
doing I traced sounds through the labyrinth of
numerous avenues to their original sources&mdash;<em>the
organism of all our faculties, instead of being confined
to their end organs, being widespread over our entire
system</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Physiologists as a rule are satisfied with the
<em>observation and exposition</em> of phenomena. I have
endeavored to <em>explain</em> phenomena. I have gone
"behind the returns," as politicians say. I have
lifted the mysterious veil, and have obtained glimpses
at the process of life. In this manner the voice of
the &#339;sophagus was first discovered, which, in logical
sequence, has carried me from one discovery to
another. Once in the confidence of nature, it freely
opened up to me its heart. Comprehending one
thing led me on to the comprehension of others.</p>

<p>There is no study which is as fascinating as that
pursued by introspection. It is self-compensating
in the highest degree; all facts thereby evolved being
the logical sequence of others previously ascertained.
Or, if not always in sequence, they all fit into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
same system; everything that has been ascertained
being a stone which was waiting to be placed in a
certain niche to fulfil a certain purpose in the construction
of a harmonious edifice. There was no
waste, no material entirely lost; nor will there be at
any future time. If similar studies will be pursued
by those specially fitted for the purpose, the time
may not be far distant when there will not be an
atom of our material existence whose meaning and
purpose will not be understood. The laws which I
claim to have discovered will assist in this accomplishment,
as they are of so broad a nature that
they may be said to form the substructure to forces
and conditions which are at the very root of our
existence. I do not pretend to say that in this
little book they have been properly treated, nor
that I possess the ability, under the best of circumstances,
to thus treat them. I have but stated what
has come under my observation, and have stated it
in as simple and direct a manner as my instinct and
my ability have taught me to state it.</p>

<p>I have been up on Mount Washington to see the
sun rise. It was a beautiful picture; still, there
were clouds in the way which here and there obscured
my vision, as was to be expected from the
unwonted height to which I had risen, and the distant
horizon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am not writing for a class, but for the multitude
to which I belong, and of which, in its aspirations,
its hopes, its sincerity, and its ignorance regarding
<em>specific</em> knowledge, I form a part. Hence my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
thoughts are its thoughts and my language its
language. There will be no difficulty, therefore,
for <em>all</em> to understand me and to profit by my
experience.</p>

<p>My observations result in the triumph of the sensation,
the feeling (common to all), over the exact
sciences (known to but few). Science, for the most
part, is satisfied with dissecting or analyzing. My
endeavor has been to construct; to form the whole
out of parts instead of reducing the whole into parts.
My guide has been instinct coupled with common-sense,&mdash;that
rarest of all the senses in spite of its
name. How far it has guided me aright, it will be
the province of science to judge.</p>

<p>I may be asked why, in treating upon so "simple"
a subject as the human voice (my only endeavor in
the beginning), I want to move heaven and earth,
and press them into my service. My answer is,
Wherever I touched the subject of the voice, I
found it to be in correlation with all other subjects.</p>

<p>My great desire now is, that I may be granted the
time and retain the ability to write out all I have
ascertained; while my greatest wonder is, that these
things should have waited for me at all to be made
known; why they should not have been discovered
centuries ago. My eyes once opened, I found them
lying about within the easy reach of my arm and the
mere assistance of my pick and shovel, like precious
ore in a newly discovered mining country. I had
but to open the lid of the mysterious casket which
had been intrusted to me, and all these great
truths escaped from the same; not to disappear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
however, as they did in the fable, but to remain
with me and to be made known through me to the
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best part of my life has been spent in this,
my adopted country. Though I experience no
difficulty in expressing myself in the English language,
still it is not my native tongue, and I sometimes
feel as if I might have said some things better
if I had said them in German.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Looking at the many volumes written on the subject
of the larynx alone, and considering that during
all this time its associate, the replica, without whose
assistance <em>not one</em> vocal sound can ever be uttered,
has remained unknown, though in plain sight and
"in everybody's mouth," one cannot help but think
of Goethe's lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ein Kerl der speculirt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ist wie ein Thier, auf duerrer Haide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Von einem boesen Geist im Kreis herum gefuehrt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Und ringsumher liegt schoene gruene Waide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">("A theorist is like unto a beast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On barren soil by evil sprite led round and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a narrow circle, though beyond there is a feast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of pasture green on fertile ground.")<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h3>"THE BASIC LAW OF VOCAL UTTERANCE"</h3>

<p>My earlier work, entitled as above, was written
under peculiar circumstances. After discovering
the fact that sounds proceed from beneath as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
as from above the tongue, light streamed in upon
me on so many subjects I had previously attempted
to solve that I was almost dazed thereby. I
thought it my duty to make these matters known,
and attempted to describe them as they appeared to
me. They were all perfectly clear to me, and even
to-day there is scarcely a thing I then said that
does not wholly stand its ground. Still, to-day,
viewing things from an advanced point of view,
much of that which was then expressed pragmatically,
almost in a single sentence, and which then
appeared to be sufficient, I am convinced requires
considerable elaboration and elucidation.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, this dictum: "The manner in
which we breathe for speech is by raising and lowering
the tongue," etc. This is perfectly correct, and
positive proof will be advanced hereafter as to its
being so.</p>

<p>I thought these matters would be readily understood,
not knowing at that time that between the
manner in which I had reached conclusions and the
one in which conclusions had been reached by others
who had also made a study of these matters, there
was a vast difference. Unknown to myself I had
lived a life of my own. I had given myself up to
these matters in a manner no one ever had before;
having been everlastingly at it, holding on with a
tenacity that knew no restraint. In this manner I
wrung facts from nature that may have never been
intended to be revealed.</p>

<p>There was something Faust-like in it all, and I
sometimes shudder at my own temerity. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
I had no such thought when I so persistently continued
trying to fathom the mystery of vocal sounds.
Viewing it in its proper light it was a narrow and
every-day undertaking. I was fairly staggered, therefore,
when I reached such unlooked-for results.</p>

<p>The reader, however, may ask, and I feel it incumbent
upon me, as well, to tell him, What was the
nature of these results? Wherein consisted these
discoveries? They covered a large field and whole
range of knowledge. They had reference more particularly
to vocal sounds. These, in fact, had almost
exclusively occupied my mind for many years. These
apparently simple factors, vocal sounds, I have since
ascertained are the outcome of laws, forces, and
agencies, and combinations of all these, which largely
make up the sum and substance of our spiritual existence.
The direct nature of vocal sounds, therefore,
cannot be well treated upon till some understanding
has been arrived at of the nature of the elements out
of which they are composed. I was rash enough to
attempt to explain them, especially the consonant
sounds, in this little book of mine, from a standpoint
I had then arrived at. Others have tried to explain
them from a much narrower standpoint still. From
that standpoint I offered explanations as to our mode
of speaking, breathing, as to defective speech, etc.
Although this was an advanced standpoint, and
well worthy the consideration of scientists, it was a
standpoint far beneath the one I have arrived at
since.</p>

<p>In attempting to scale a mountain I had reached
a point from which I could overlook the valley im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>mediately
beneath my feet. I have since gone up
much higher. Yet there are towering heights still
above me which I shall never be able to reach.
From this it will be seen how difficult it would be
for me to state in a few paragraphs what I had actually
ascertained. That book, however, will increase
in value in the course of time, not only for the
knowledge it contains, but historically, so to say, as
the beginning of an evolution which, it seems to me,
will eventually embrace all sciences in regard to
man; when treated, as they will be, from a standpoint
of inner as against one of outer consciousness,
from the standpoint of the soul and the heart,
as in the inadequacy of our expressions I have to
call them, as against that of the head and the
senses.</p>

<p>I have since arrived at a plan according to which
these matters will be treated in a more systematic
manner. In <em>this</em> volume, besides many novel subjects,
I have been enlarging upon and elucidating
many superficially mentioned in my book, <cite>The Basic
Law of Vocal Utterance</cite>. Still, the matters treated
upon even in <em>this</em> book cover so much ground, and
had to be condensed to such an extent, that many of
these also will require further enlargement and elucidation.
This will be attempted to be done in future
publications. Meantime I trust these matters will
be taken in hand by others, who by their writings
will relieve me of some of this additional labor.
Take it all in all, there is so much of this work that
I feel as if I had swallowed the ocean and was now
called upon to give an account of its contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE VOICE OF THE &#338;SOPHAGUS AND ITS VOCAL
CORDS</h3>

<p>Among the discoveries mentioned in my former
publication one stands out most prominent, and it
is the basis of all my other discoveries; namely,
"that the voice is of a dual nature." I had ascertained
that sounds circulate around the radix of the
tongue; that they, or rather the air wave which
carries them, enters either at the upper surface of
the tip of the tongue and recedes back, to come out
again from beneath its lower surface, or vice versa.
I had also ascertained that the former process is the
English, the latter the German, for breathing and
vocal expression.</p>

<p>I was convinced that this signified a circulation of
vocal sounds; and though I had finally also reached
this conclusion and intimated it, namely, "that we
breathe and speak through the &#339;sophagus," I did
not express it in so many words, as I meant to leave
this expression for a future publication. I was at
first under the impression that both waves belonged
to the trachea, the one that was ingoing as well as
the one which was outgoing.</p>

<p>Meantime I had discovered the "larynx or voice-box
to the &#339;sophagus," but considered this at first
also as belonging to the trachea. I thought inspiration
and ingoing sounds belonged to the vocal cords
of the trachea, expiration and outgoing sounds to
this "new" vocal cord located beneath the tongue.
To study these first attempts, by which I was trying
to find my way, and which culminated in these wonderful
discoveries, I presume would be of interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the student. I can here mention only the main
points.</p>

<p>I have found beyond a doubt, and my future
statements will more fully establish this fact, that
the fr&aelig;num lingu&aelig; and the parts of the mucous
membrane surrounding the same are relatively of
the same nature in regard to the voice of the &#339;sophagus
that the vocal cords and other parts of the
larynx are in relation to that of the trachea.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the larynx, I named these
entire surroundings the "replica," as, in conjunction
with the tip of the tongue resting upon the
same, they conform to the shape of the oral cavity,
of which in their general appearance they are almost
a counterpart. In a similar manner I named the
special part thereof, which "regulates" the intonation,
the "vocal lip," in contradistinction to the
vocal cords of the larynx, which perform the same
service for the voice of the trachea.</p>

<p>After making such positive assertions regarding
the replica as I did in my previous publication&mdash;now
more than four years ago&mdash;I was more than surprised
that no one should have deemed it worth his while
to look into the value of these assertions. If any
one had, he could not have helped but acknowledge
their correctness. It is but necessary to utter any
vocal sound whatsoever, either vowel or consonant,
and while doing so watch the vocal lip and the fr&aelig;num,
to become at once convinced that their motions
are of precisely the same order as those of the larynx
and the vocal cords.</p>

<p>So many have spent year after year upon the diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>cult
and "fruitless" endeavor to study the motions
of the larynx; while here is an opportunity plainly
before every one's eyes to study, without effort, the
most interesting phenomena in voice production.
We must be obliged to seek for a thing high and low
before we deem it worthy of our attention.</p>

<h2>THE HUMAN VOICE</h2>


<p>What is the voice&mdash;a spirit, or "an expiratory
current of air set into vibration by purely
physical agencies"? It does not seem to me to be
either, but something which is of the nature of both:
our dual nature, embodied in the sounds of speech;
our body and soul joining hands to produce the miracle
of the voice. Regarding the materialistic view
quoted above, which is held by most of the investigators,
who make the larynx their <em>point d'appui</em>, I
think that if there is anything in our composition
or emanating therefrom that is <em>not</em> produced by
"<em>purely</em> physical agencies," it is the voice.</p>

<p>In my opinion there is nothing purer, more
"spiritual," in the world than a beautiful voice.
Did you ever <em>see</em> a spirit? Perhaps not. But you
have often <em>heard</em> one. You hear them daily,
hourly, constantly; other spirits as well as your
own&mdash;the spirits represented by the voice; the
soul incorporated in the sounds of speech. When
you converse, it is soul to soul; when you hear an
anthem sung, it is the soul of the singer to the soul
of the universe. The soul reveals itself most prominently
through the voice when there is anguish in
it, or joy; tears or laughter; love or hate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>An attempt to get at the truth in matters of the
voice is an attempt at getting at the truth in matters
of life. If you will tell me <em>all</em> that a vocal sound
is, I will tell you what your soul is.</p>

<p>To examine into the anatomical construction of
the larynx, to watch it physiologically and learn to
understand the motions of the vocal cords in their
relation to vocal sounds, is not much more than looking
at the dial of a clock (a simile already used, but
worth repeating). The movements of the hands will
give you <em>no</em> cue to the construction of the intricate
works hidden behind the face of the clock. Nor
will the careful examination and observation of the
"dials" which serve the voice of the &#339;sophagus in
the same manner as those of the larynx serve the
voice of the trachea, measurably increase the knowledge
of vocal phenomena. I do believe, however,
that, inasmuch as the movements of the replica, the
fr&aelig;num, and the vocal lip fit into and complement
those of the larynx and its vocal cords, and vice
versa, lessons of great benefit to the knowledge and
the improvement of vocal utterance may be learned,
<em>after</em> we have once begun to understand what these
movements imply.</p>

<p>That we cannot now derive any benefit from the
observation of these motions is due to the fact that
they are <em>reflex</em>, <em>involuntary</em>, <em>uncontrolled</em> and <em>uncontrollable</em>
by the will. Or, as Mme. D'Arona
expresses it:</p>

<p>"They are not the <em>cause</em> of the perfect tone, but
are simply acted upon by the cause."</p>

<p>After having become acquainted with the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
these motions, and having learned to control it in
the interest of pure and perfect tone, the movements
of the larynx and the replica will become of value
to us as "indicators" of the correct or incorrect
exercise of the cause which they reflect. In "recording"
the original movements they will show us
what is right or wrong in the latter, and will thus
offer us an opportunity for correcting them. Up to
the present they have been simply barometers,
which, no matter how closely we may observe them,
offer us no opportunity for changing "the state of
the weather" which they indicate. After thoroughly
comprehending the <em>causes</em>, however, which
move them, we may shape the course of the latter
in conformity with our will. Or, vice versa, we
may shape our will, which, after all, is the <em>first
cause</em>, so as to correct that which they indicate to
be wrong in our tone production.</p>

<p>Now, what is that which the will acts upon, and
thus becomes the original source, the first cause, so
to say, of tone production? My answer will be a
surprise, for, as far as I know, no one has ever as
much as thought, even, of looking in this direction
for the seat of the voice.</p>

<p>The original source of tone production has its
location in <em>various vessels of the viscera</em>: in the
lungs, the kidneys, and the bladder, for the most
part, though many other vessels, if not all, participate,
and are more or less involved in its production.
Besides these vessels, the heart and the
solar plexus, as central organs of the vascular and
nervous systems, together with the brain as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
central seat of thought and the will, perform parts
of the highest importance in tone production and
vocal utterance. In the lungs, the bladder, and the
kidneys, together with their coadjutors, the bronchi
and ureters, <em>the tone originates</em>. Here we can control,
and unconsciously do control, it.</p>

<p>I shall adduce indubitable proof as to the correctness
of these assertions. More than that, I shall <em>locate</em>
sounds in these various vessels. As a tone proceeds
from a given string located in a given part of a
musical instrument, and cannot proceed from or be
produced on any other string, a given tone of the
human voice proceeds from a given vessel, and
cannot proceed from or be produced in any other
vessel.</p>

<p>I shall furthermore show that the various shades
of a tone proceed from various parts of such vessel.
Yet, while tones are produced in special parts, the
instrument of the voice being of a sympathetic
nature, <em>all</em> parts of the <em>viscera</em> participate therein,
by, in a manner, <em>leaning</em> towards a vessel in which
a tone is produced, thus assisting in giving it utterance.
If a sound is produced in one of the vessels
of the abdomen, those of the thorax, though not
directly participating therein, give it aid and comfort
by their passivity, thus throwing the entire
strength of the voice-producing forces into this one
spot. If a sound is produced in the thorax, the
vessels of the abdomen aid it in a similar manner.
This is more particularly the case when a sound of
a superior order is to be produced, which is thus
<em>reinforced</em> by this aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>In matters of the voice, as in many others, truth
is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>Dr. Rush has said:</p>

<p>"Some day, when the real instrument of the
voice will be discovered, it will be found to be of an
order far different in its nature and construction from
that which it has ever been supposed to be."</p>

<p>The greatest mechanical wonder, however, is that
the voice, and that which is apparently one and the
same sound, should under different circumstances
emanate from sources so entirely different in their
construction as the vocal cords to the trachea and
those to the &#339;sophagus, the viscera of the kidneys,
the bladder and the lungs, etc. This fact
also accounts for the mystery which, like an impenetrable
veil, has hung over the features of the
voice. Who has ever thought of looking for the
spirit of the voice to reveal itself from <em>beneath</em> the
tongue? Who has ever thought that the &#339;sophagus
was a breathing-tube of a similar functional order as
the trachea? Who has thought that the viscera of
the abdomen were playing as important a part in
breathing as the lungs? Who has thought that the
hemisphere of the abdomen was as directly amenable
to the influence of the air as that of the thorax?
Who has, in fine, thought that the viscera of the
abdomen together with those of the thorax were
primarily instrumental in producing the voice and
vocal utterance?</p>

<p>It may not be pleasant to know, and it may not
quite conform with our &aelig;sthetic taste, that the "voice
divine" should have its origin in such vessels as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
kidneys and the bladder; but I have no quarrel with
the Creator, and can but wonder, as I have never
ceased to wonder from step to step in all these investigations,
at the marvellous resources of nature.
There is one great lesson conveyed through this,
namely,&mdash;- that the body is <em>divine</em> in its <em>every aspect</em>;
parts which have been supposed to serve ends only
of a comparatively low order participating in the
highest spiritual functions.</p>

<p>This knowledge is the sanctification of the "flesh,"
so constantly and unjustifiably rejected and reviled
as against that of the spirit. I am not dealing with
theories, but am stating facts which will be as positively
proven as any other scientific facts ever have
been proven. These proofs will not be all forthcoming
in this book, however, there being other
subjects of equal, if not greater, importance that I
have to deal with before I can reach them; these
subjects being of such a nature that they must be
explained before those immediately connected with
voice production can be properly dealt with.</p>

<p>I have been reproached with attempting too much;
with dealing with too many subjects at one and the
same time; that I ought to complete one theme and
then take hold of another. Just so; but this cannot
be done. I must first deal with general principles.
Our entire system being of a homogeneous nature,
I cannot deal with separate issues until these principles
have been dealt with and understood in their
entirety. Besides, I cannot hope to ever <em>complete</em>
any one thing. I shall be well satisfied if I shall be
able to simply touch upon every subject that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
come under my observation, lightly, suggesting
things, and leaving it to others to enter more thoroughly
into the same.</p>


<h3>INTROSPECTION</h3>

<p>With our mortal eyes turned outwardly we cannot
see spiritual things, nor the motive power of life,
nor the material form the spirit assumes in moving
the mechanism of the body. For there <em>is</em> a
material way in which it is thus moved, as there
necessarily must be, and I have obtained glimpses
thereat by turning my eyes inwardly&mdash;by looking
into myself with the <em>inner</em> surface of my eyes.</p>

<p>Yet through all these centuries people have been
using that portion of their eyes which is intended
for external vision only, in a vain endeavor to arrive
at spiritual-material facts. Thus the larynx, as the
supposed seat of the voice, has been subjected to
scrutiny based upon laws derived from phenomena
which owe their origin to physical causes only.
During this vain endeavor the larynx has been subjected
to torture and maltreatment worse than that
inflicted upon a medi&aelig;val witch.</p>

<p>But its tormentors have derived no solace from
this treatment, not even that of a confession of imaginary
sins. Why not? Simply because it had
not anything to confess, being a reflex, an indirect,
and not a free and original agent. Through torture
(by means of the laryngoscope), the destroyer
of harmony, we cannot arrive at laws based upon
harmony.</p>

<p>Is not all physiological research more or less of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
this order? The "higher law" of science may demand
its victims, even as did the "higher law" of
the church. I do not wish to say, however, that the
sacrifice of animals on the altar of science is as useless
as that of human beings used to be on that of
religion. Vivisection, however, while it may, and
no doubt sometimes does, help to recognize the
physical cause of disorder, will never be of any value
in arriving at spiritual causes and the recognition of
the inner motive power of life, nor to any great extent
at that of the exercise of our faculties and functions.
For this knowledge we require a different
mode of proceeding. To penetrate into the realm
of the spiritual-material world (and all phenomena of
life are of that nature) we must not look externally
but internally, not into other beings but into ourselves.
That is the only place where we can hope
to find it in action and arrive at the causes of such
action.</p>

<p>As our being cannot enter into the inner life of
another being and identify itself with the same or
become a part thereof, or remain apart and become a
spectator of the same or substitute therefor (not even
for that of the simplest and lowest living vegetable
or animal organism), we would have to despair of
our ability of ever being able to arrive at the laws
governing life, if we were not able to look into our
own lives by substituting for our observations our
inner for our outer consciousness.</p>

<p>The word "Introspection" has heretofore meant
reflection upon purely spiritual phenomena only; I
have proven by my personal example that we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
observe physiologico-psychological phenomena with
considerable accuracy&mdash;very little of this kind of
work, as far as I can learn, ever having been done
before. The nearest approach at amalgamation,
probably, is that which is brought about by means
of hypnotism. In this instance the two factors, the
positive and the negative, the operator and the person
operated upon, do not fuse, however, and become
one, but remain entities, each in his own right. Or,
to speak still more to the point, while the positive,
that is the spiritual, factor of the operator may, and
no doubt does, join hands with the negative, that is
the material, of his subject, by which the operator
becomes one with the latter, there is still but an
<em>influence</em>, and not an insight. Besides, this condition
is as yet too obscurely known to be made use of as a
practical means of observation.</p>

<p>After all this, the question will still be asked,
"What must we <em>do</em> to look into ourselves?"</p>

<p>I will admit that I have not stated what others
should do, but in explaining what I have done I
mean to explain what general course others will
have to pursue. By taking into consideration what
I have said, and adding thereto what I shall still
have to say, a general idea may be formed of what
the reader must do to place himself in a position to
make original observations by means of introspection.
No two cases being just alike, from the fact
that heredity, the mental capacity, physical condition,
education, temperament, nationality, etc., with
no two persons are just alike, it is not well possible
to point out a course quite suitable to all. I might as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
well attempt to arrive at a law by the observance of
which <em>all</em> persons would be enabled to write poetry.</p>

<p>Still, needing assistance in this vast undertaking,
I am particularly anxious to make this matter clear,
as the results of these observations are of vital interest
to all, and I am but one weak, ignorant mortal
creature, with but a small fraction of a life
left to me in which to state that which it would
at least take a full lifetime to properly and fully explain.
I am overburdened with an insight which is
being increased daily, even against my will, and
which I shall never be able to fully communicate to
others. Let the flood-gates of truth once be opened
and come in upon you as they have upon me, and
you will be overwhelmed by the mass of their detail
no less than by the vigor of their mass. My great
want, therefore, for the purpose of more fully arriving
at these facts and obtaining ever higher results
is assistance and co&ouml;peration. I wish it to be distinctly
understood, however, that I do not mean this
in a personal sense&mdash;far from it; but in the interest
and the promotion of science, as everybody wanting
to make original observations must pursue these
studies for himself and by himself.</p>

<p>Why such a course has not been heretofore pursued
by others I am at a loss to understand, except
from the fact that it takes an unusual amount of
perseverance to reach the first results. Though <em>all</em>
persons may not be able to personally obtain satisfactory
results, <em>all</em> may be <em>benefited</em> by the results
obtained by those qualified to successfully carry on
a course of observations by means of introspection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The world at large will always have to be satisfied
with being simply the beneficiary of scientific research;
more especially of research in matters spiritual
or psychical. From facts thus obtained rules
may be deduced, which, translated into "physical
forms," may become the property of all. In this
manner numerous observations I have made have
already assumed a practical shape; but I have not
as yet been able to devote the necessary time to
them to produce a system which may be used for
general instruction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I do sincerely hope that others will take
hold of these matters in all seriousness, and assist
me in arriving at these practical physical forms, which
I trust, in fact <em>know</em> beyond the shadow of a doubt,
will be fruitful of the most beneficent results in the
teaching of the deaf, of singing and elocution, of pure
vocal utterance in speaking; in curing stammering
and other chronic faulty or deficient utterance; besides
numerous other matters of equal importance
not in immediate connection with vocal utterance.</p>

<p>That these matters must be and are of the greatest
importance to the medical student goes without
saying. It is to be hoped that they may lead to
a more rational treatment of our frail and often
ailing bodies. I say "bodies" because this is the
common phrase. Yet how false this is, every true
physician is but too conscious of. Our ailments
cannot be successfully treated from a mere physical
standpoint. The question of life is not a mechanical
one; it is spiritual beyond anything else, the
spirit being the motive power giving life to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
otherwise inert physical body. Yet the only endeavor
of the physician has always been to cure
the "machine," to set its mechanism right again
when it is out of order, simply because he has not
been able to get at the spiritual motive power which
propels it.</p>

<p>I have been trying to get at this motive power,
and to some extent have been successful in so doing.
Besides, the <em>body</em> never suffers. Its ailments make
the soul suffer; while the ailments of the soul have
a comparatively less injurious effect upon the body.
The body is the habitation of the soul. The soul
dwells in its <em>every</em> part. As long as this habitation
is habitable the soul continues to dwell therein.
When it becomes uninhabitable the soul departs,
never to return. Hence a body, never so frail and
ailing, will continue to live as long as a vital part is
not affected, that is, a part the soul <em>requires</em> for its
habitation and cannot do without. Close such part
to the indwelling of the soul, prevent material and
spiritual factors from joining hands therein, and the
spirit departs. Once departed it can never be made
to return. Hence a body in the full vigor of health,
after having been immersed in water sufficiently
long to have any one vital avenue positively closed
against the indwelling of the soul, cannot be resuscitated.
As long as the soul clings to it, however,
with never so feeble a grasp, it may come to life
again, in the same manner that a flame nearly extinguished
may be fanned to life again.</p>

<p>For me to <em>fully</em> describe my mode of proceeding
in arriving at these matters would be equal to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
attempt at crowding into a few paragraphs <em>all</em> I
have gone through within something like forty
years, more or less, of observation.</p>


<h3>MAKING PARTS RIGID</h3>

<p>I have already stated that I was originally led into
making these investigations through my simple desire
of getting rid of my <em>German</em> mode of expression
in speaking the English language. Being determined
to find out where the trouble was which prevented
me from producing pure English sounds
while I experienced no difficulty in producing pure
German sounds, I pursued vocal sounds, through
numerous phases, to their original sources. The
endeavor to arrive at the true nature of vocal sounds
through autology and by means of "introspection"
has, no doubt, been made by thousands before me.
The reason they were not more successful must be
attributed to the simple fact that such persons have
been lacking in perseverance. It is one of the most
misleading endeavors one can pursue.</p>

<p>In the beginning I came to what I considered a
<em>positive</em> result perhaps for the hundredth time, but
to think I was on the wrong track the one hundred
and first time. I would then, perhaps, finally determine
that the first result arrived at, after all, was the
correct one. In this manner I have in the course
of time arrived at positive conclusions, which have
been the basis of all my investigations, and are undoubtedly
correct, as they have yielded up one result
after another and have never proven false. For this,
relatively speaking, "perfect insight" I have waited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
before saying anything more at all, since my previous
(preliminary) publication. To these conclusions I
owe my present trust and confidence, and the "boldness
and temerity," as some may say, in making such
"startling declarations" in the face of the accumulated
wisdom of the science of this and of past ages.
Yet I am tired unto death of prevarication and of
time-serving, and will say what I consider to be the
truth, no matter what may be the consequence.</p>

<p>Any one singing a false note or mispronouncing
a foreign word or sound, yet knowing what the
right note, word, or sound is and should be, can do
the same thing, and by perseverance finally find
what he has been looking for and pronounce such
note, word, or sound in its entire purity. This will
put him on the track to the production of <em>all</em> pure
notes or sounds. To accomplish this, he must
persistently watch one result after another.</p>

<p>My mode of proceeding has been largely in making
parts <em>rigid</em>, and then observing the consequences.
In pursuing this course for some time, you will finally
attain such a mastery therein that you will be able
to make almost any vessel, muscle, sinew, membrane,
tissue, etc., or any <em>part</em> thereof, rigid. This
is done for the purpose of neutralizing parts which
partake in the production of sounds, and will enable
you to closely watch cause and effect in your natural,
as well as artistic, course of breathing and sound
production. <em>Having two languages at my command,
I was startled to find that cause and effect in both were
totally different from each other.</em> This gave me the
original cue to all my observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>In place of sounds, others may pursue odor, taste,
feeling, motion, hearing, etc., to their original
sources, and make similar observations. In so
doing they will find that <em>all phenomena, the products
of our faculties, abilities, or gifts, originally proceed
from the same or similar sources; that there is a
homogeneity of proceeding, mainly consisting in various
modes of breathing, in the production of them all; the
end organs of our senses or gifts finally determining
definite special results</em>.</p>

<p>For vocal utterance, we draw our inspiration for
various results to be attained, from the air, and
breathe in a different mode for every special performance.
These modes of breathing, though the
same for all persons in a general sense and leading
through the same channels, in a more restricted
sense are different for every nationality.</p>

<p>There is no "danger" connected with these pursuits,
in spite of Mr. Heidenhain's fears; which fact is
due to the duality of the nature of each and all our
various faculties, there being a safety-valve always at
the other end in the shape of the negative factor.
The only danger I have discovered was in connection
with the "streams of life," which do not permit
tampering with without penalty. As these
exist independent of our ordinary mode of breathing,
they are not apt to be interfered with by any
neophyte in the pursuits now under consideration.
Of these powerful streams, of which no notice has
ever been taken by any one, though ceaselessly
streaming into and out of our system while life
lasts, I shall take occasion to speak later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>


<h3>EXTIRPATION</h3>

<p>To make a part "rigid" is equal to the "extirpation"
of such part. While it is in a state of rigidity,
it ceases to take part in any action whatsoever;
it is inert and the same as if it had ceased to exist.
What advantage, then, let me ask, is there in extirpating
parts in animals, when we can, by making
parts rigid, directly extirpate such parts in ourselves?
We can in this manner suppress the action of any
muscle, or the participation of any vessel, or part of
such vessel, in any act, by the simple exercise of our
volition. I find no difficulty in thus "extirpating"
any such part from myself for the time being, and
then observing the consequences. I can take hold
of the innermost part of myself, so to say, and take
it <em>out of myself</em>. In regard to vocal utterance, these
consequences are positive and direct. That these
operations must be very <em>carefully</em> conducted in connection
with <em>vital</em> parts goes without saying. The
action of muscles participating in the production of
vocal utterance, however, or in the act of breathing,
except the muscles of the heart, can be suppressed
without danger. I am thus in a position to modify
extirpation of parts to any extent, almost, I desire.
I can add to and detract therefrom at will, and can
shift the act of extirpation from the anterior part of
a vessel to its posterior, or from its superior to its
inferior, or vice versa, now making one side rigid,
then the other, now one end, and then the other; or
take hold of its centre and leave the other parts free,
or suppress its circumference and leave the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
free. There is scarcely a limit to the action of my
will in handling my subject. All this while, my
feelings, my intelligence, my mind, take in every
phase of these proceedings, and enable me to give
a correct account of the results I have been observing.</p>

<p>This discovery&mdash;for a discovery it must be, as I
can find no account of any similar proceeding ever
having been carried on&mdash;should, and I hope will,
put an end to vivisection, when it is resorted to for
the purpose of learning anything whatever in respect
to the action and the process of life. By this proceeding
I have more or less successfully observed
the acts of breathing, of vocal utterance, motion
and locomotion, hearing, seeing, and thinking.</p>

<p>I beg leave to here insert without comment the
following clipping from the press:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The following extracts are from a lecture on "Vivisection
in Relation to Medical Science," delivered by
Edward Berdoe, M. R. C. S., etc., at Cambridge. Lovers
of animals may be glad to know how the medical fraternity
amuse themselves:</p>

<p>"You may open the abdomens of living cats, guinea-pigs,

exposed intestines, causing what you are pleased to term
'peculiar rhythmic movements' and 'circus movements,'
but what the unlearned would call violent spasms and
convulsions, as was done by Dr. Batten and Mr. Bokenham,
at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, last year. You may
dissect out the kidneys of living dogs and cats which
you have first paralyzed by curare&mdash;the 'hellish oorali'

move a limb, or to bite, scratch, howl, or otherwise interfere
with the operator's comfort. You may do this, as
was done by Dr. John Rose Bradford, at University College,
London. You may infect ninety cats with cholera
poison, and bake numbers of them alive, as did Dr.
Lander Brunton. You may inoculate the eyes of rabbits

stitch them into the muscles of the backs of rabbits,
then crush them amongst their tissues, as did Dr. Watson
Cheyne, at King's College, London. You may slice,
plough, burn, and pick away the brains of monkeys and
dogs, as did Dr. Ferrier. You may slowly starve to death
animals whose vagi nerves have been cut and stimulated
by electricity, as was done by Dr. Gaskell, of this University,
in 1878. You may cut out the spleens and livers
from living rabbits, pigeons, and ducks, as was done by
Dr. William Hunter, of St. John's College, Cambridge,
in 1888, or do a thousand other acts which in a coster-monger
or a farm laborer would be termed and dealt
with as acts of atrocious cruelty, punishable by imprisonment.
But you have not learned the cure for a single
malady which afflicts the human body."</p></div>


<h3>THE MOVEMENTS OF THE TONGUE</h3>

<p>There is another mode of proceeding by which
satisfactory results can be obtained, and which was
the only one I resorted to in the beginning and for
many years afterwards; namely, the watching of the
movements of the tongue.</p>

<p>The muscle of the tongue, for vocal utterance, is
the most important in our organization. It appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to me, in fact, as if in its tip there were a concentration
of all the threads which control our existence; and
that it is, therefore, representative of an epitome of
our entire being. As all sciences, in a general, though
in some instances perhaps somewhat remote, sense,
centre in the science of life, so do the controlling
elements in our composition centre in the tip of the
tongue. If it were possible to analyze it spiritually
as well as physically, we would obtain a compendium
of knowledge far in advance of any there is in existence
in the world at the present time. Still, it must
be admitted that this would, to some extent, depend
upon <em>whose</em> tongue's tip was submitted to such
analyzation. The fact of the tip of the tongue
being removed by surgical operation without serious
effect upon the mental condition of the individual
does not greatly affect my assertion. In that case
the concentration must have taken place at the
tongue's new tip or end.</p>

<p>The tongue's tip, with as infallible correctness as
the magnetic needle points towards the north pole,
indicates the exact spot whence sounds come, or
should come, to appear on the surface in a clear and
undefiled manner. The tongue's tip, for English
vowel sounds, does not touch any part of the oral
cavity. It is constantly changing its position, however,
and for every vowel sound, or shade of a vowel
sound, points in the direction of or <em>approaches</em> the spot
whence a sound comes, or should come. To ascertain
such spot with exactitude, it is but necessary to
<em>extend</em> the tongue's tip until it reaches the wall of
the oral cavity during or, still better, immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
after the utterance of a vocal sound. Upon reaching
that spot the tongue may continue in the same
position of contact and the sound can still be uttered
with entire purity. Change this point of contact,
however, but in the least, and such sound will at
once cease to come to the surface. Yet, while <em>apparently</em>
a sound comes from the direction in which
the tip of the tongue points, this is not really the
case. In pointing in a given direction, the tongue
opens up the channels of the &#339;sophagus and the
trachea in a special manner for the proper emission of
a given sound, beneath as well as above, and to the
left as well as to the right of its radix. In changing
the tongue's position but in the least, these channels
will open in a different direction, which may then
be the proper medium for the emission of another
sound, but not for the one under consideration.</p>

<p>The general mode in which the radix of the tongue
turns upon its axis is the direct and fundamental
cause productive of the various languages of the
world; such general mode necessitating special movements
of the tongue for the production of the sounds
of any special language. Regarding the proper emission
of consonant sounds every one knows that the
same depends upon the particular spot of contact of
the tongue's tip with parts of the oral cavity. As
a matter of fact, such point of contact also opens,
the same as with vowel sounds, the tubes of the
trachea and &#339;sophagus at the tongue's radix in the
proper manner for the emission of a given stream of
air for the production of such consonant sounds.</p>

<p>Every imaginable opprobrious epithet has been by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
singers bestowed upon the tongue. "This obstreperous
muscle which is always in the way," says one.
"This troublesome member will persist in going up
when you want it to remain down"; "intractable,"
"contrary," "obstinate," "wilful," "ungovernable,"
"stubborn." All these expressions have
been used by writers on the voice in connection with
the tongue, simply because it would not yield to
unreasonable and unnatural demands made upon it;
the tongue, being a free agent, persisting in its
natural rights&mdash;as much so as any independent democratic
citizen persists in his.</p>

<p>My observations having been made in connection
with a foreign language, I had a better opportunity
for watching my tongue's movements than I would
have had had I attempted to watch them in connection
with my native tongue; the movements of the
tongue in connection with the latter being so rapid
and involuntary that it becomes exceedingly difficult
to make any observations at all. It was like having
this foreign (English) tongue exist independently
alongside of my own, my intelligence watching it,
and guiding it, now here, now there, until it would
touch the right spot for the right English sound.
Knowing what the right sound was and should be,
I never stopped until the same came to the surface.</p>

<p>In trying to find my way in this foreign (English)
territory of the oral cavity, I might compare my
English tongue to the stick in the hands of a blind
man, who uses it in place of his eyes to ascertain his
whereabouts, so as to enable him to proceed on his
way in the right direction. With my "stick" I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
felt in every direction, till I found I could steer clear
of obstacles straight into the channel of the sound I
had been seeking. From my German post of observation
I was thus enabled to watch the movements
of my English tongue in its efforts to find
itself "at home" in this foreign territory, while I
was at the same time guiding it from one point
therein to another.</p>

<p>I want to call especial attention to and reiterate
the fact that the exact point whence a sound proceeds,
or seems to proceed, can, by extending the
tongue's tip, be quite as well (if not better) ascertained,
<em>after</em> the utterance of a sound, as <em>during</em>
such utterance; that is <em>immediately</em> after the tongue
has ceased to vibrate for such sound.</p>

<p>The difference in the movements of the tongue
for various languages is one of the most interesting
observations to be made in connection with these
studies. The German language being the exact
opposite, the antipode, to the English, after comprehending
the movements of the tongue for the
latter, its own movements, that is, the movements
of the tongue for German sounds, were not difficult
for me to ascertain.</p>

<p>It is an anomaly to apply the works of German
writers on the voice to the study of the English language,
or to that of any other than the German
language; or to apply books written from an English
standpoint to the study of any language except the
English&mdash;the movements of the tongue, and, in sympathy
therewith, of countless other muscles, being
different for every language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever the movements of the tongue are for
the <em>spoken</em> language, they are of an inverse order for
<em>song</em>. I anticipate in making the following statement,
namely, that while speech is of an order which
is rapid, direct, anterior, exterior, spontaneous, impulsive,
and material, song is of an order which is
slow, indirect, posterior, interior, premeditated, contemplative,
and spiritual. I will also add this: that,
<em>while speech is of the oral cavity, song is of the
pharynx</em>. In making these remarks and others <em>in
anticipation</em>, I do so intentionally and for a purpose;
not so much in expectation that they will be at
once and fully understood, as with a view of setting
others thinking on these subjects until I can reach
them in due course of time; or, if I should <em>never</em>
be able to reach them, that the principle, at least,
underlying the same, which if the opportunity had
been granted me would have been fully sustained,
shall not be lost. The reader will notice that I am
hurrying over the ground as rapidly as I consistently
can, even from my&mdash;under the best of circumstances&mdash;superficial
standpoint, leaving wide gaps to be
filled in by others in the course of time.</p>


<h3>SIMPLE SOUNDS</h3>

<p>Speaking of sounds in making experiments in
connection with the movements of the tongue, it is
of the first importance that these sounds should be
<em>simple</em> and not <em>vocal</em> or compound. They must be
sounds of the same order as we utter in whispering,
or such sounds as we are apt to use when learning to
speak a foreign tongue. They are the inharmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sounds of the deaf, and those which distinguish the
speech of a foreigner from that of the native-born.</p>

<p>The recognition of these sounds as the <em>negative
parts of speech</em> has been one of my main accomplishments,
and has been of the greatest assistance to me
in my investigations.</p>

<p>Things <em>complete</em> tell no tales. We must decompose
them, reduce them to their elements, if we want
to arrive at the truth in matters of science. I have
succeeded in doing with things spiritual&mdash;vocal
sounds&mdash;what the chemist is doing with things material.
In things complete, as they are shaped by
the hand of nature, the elements of which they are
composed are mingled in such a dexterous manner,
are so happily blended, that they adjust, counterpoise,
and complement one another, and thus live
with and in one another.</p>

<p>These new forms have been created by the elements
of which they are composed, abandoning their
separate original forms and now appearing in a new
form, as integral parts of an <em>harmonious</em> entity.
These elements have not only abandoned their form,
however, but in most instances have also changed
their character; which in their original composition
may have been of a <em>discordant</em>, violent, and even dangerous
nature. Take but the atmospheric air and
its elements for an example.</p>

<p>A similar state of affairs exists in connection with
the phenomena of the material-spiritual world.
While vocal sounds, when properly produced, stand
for all that is harmonious and pleasing, their component
parts, their positive and negative elements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
by themselves, offer features of a contrary nature.
They also offer us, the same as elements do to the
chemist while making experiments, the opportunity
for making an endless number of combinations.
Unless you know what <em>simple</em> sounds&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, negative
parts of vocal sounds&mdash;are, and know how to
produce them, you will scarcely be able to make
one class of experiments which I shall offer in great
abundance to sustain my arguments.</p>

<p>When I shall reach the subject of vocal sounds
proper, I shall more fully explain their exact nature.
I will simply say this at present: A simple sound
is the product of that hemisphere only to which it
properly belongs. A vocal sound is aided and
assisted by a complementary sound from the other
hemisphere. The more perfect such aid, the more
perfect will be its tone. Simple vowel sounds are
short, abrupt, the same as consonant sounds when
produced all by themselves and without the aid of a
vowel sound uttered in conjunction with them.</p>


<h3>POSTERIOR SURFACES</h3>

<p>In saying, as I have, that introspection is carried
on by looking into ourselves with the <em>inner surface
of our eyes</em>, I meant to say, in the first instance, that
we must exclude all exterior vision, and then attempt
to locate and follow up the course of events
going on within us. While in this state we are
strictly reduced to our personal and individual
existence. In thus "watching," the function of
our eyes, instead of being used for external material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
observation, is reversed; their function now being to
observe internally and spiritually.</p>

<p>In connection with sounds, you will not only "in
your mind's eye" <em>see</em> the places where they originate,
and <em>feel</em> the course they are taking, but you
will actually, functionally (in the mode of spiritually
seeing and feeling), "see" and "feel" them. This
vision and this feeling is far from being perfect,
however,&mdash;not being accustomed to thus seeing and
feeling,&mdash;but it may, when continuously exercised,
become so in the course of time. While in this
state, besides seeing the places interiorly, you may
also see them exteriorly, by reflection as it were,
and in a reverse order, "as in a looking-glass," in
which case it is still an interior vision reflected
exteriorly. As a matter of fact, I not only believe,
but positively <em>know</em>, that <em>every exterior functional
surface has a corresponding posterior one</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever a thing is brought <em>home</em> to us, either
through our organs of seeing, hearing, feeling,
smelling, or tasting, the outer surface of such respective
organ constitutes the positive factor for
such action, while its inner surface constitutes the
negative factor thereof. Whenever the outer world
is excluded, however, as during thought, introspection,
and in our sleep, the inner surface of any of
these organs becomes the positive, and the outer
surface the negative, factor. In thus saying, "I see
with the inner surface of my eyes," I do not mean
this figuratively only, but literally, functionally, as
well; as I could not see these places and locate them
internally nor could I see any subject or object with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
"my mind's eye," if the faculty of seeing were not
actually given to the posterior surface of the eye.</p>

<p>This will become clear when you consider that
you will altogether fail to see internally when you
attempt to use the <em>anterior</em> surface of your eye for
the purpose of <em>internal</em> vision. Thus, the phenomena
of vision which accompany thought or dreams,
during sleep as well as in our waking moments, are
not merely spiritual, but, in the sense of internal
functional vision, are also material, so to say.
<em>All</em> thought, in fact, is more or less of this same
nature. We use the posterior surfaces of our organs
of sense more frequently, in consequence, than we
do their corresponding anterior surfaces. Physiologists
will say there is no such a thing as an inner
surface of the eye capable of seeing. This does not
alter the fact that I actually, functionally, see with
the posterior surface of my eyes, and that everybody
else does the same thing.</p>

<p>I shall, in connection with vocal utterance, have
occasion to call attention to numerous divisions of as
positive a character as a wall of living tissue, of which
there is not a trace to be seen by external vision; these
divisions being channels, constantly used in one and
the same direction, some for ingoing, others for outgoing
streams of air and sounds. Of these channels,
also, being invisible to the outer surface of the eye,
science has never taken any notice. These invisible
agencies are connecting links, mediating between
cause and result, in connection with material-spiritual
or spiritual-material phenomena of whatsoever
nature brought to our consciousness. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
inability of science, in its ignorance of these agencies,
to reconcile the one with the other by the aid
of such material only as has been heretofore at its
disposal. We may <em>see</em> proceedings going on which
are mediating between cause and effect, by the assistance
of the inner surface of our eyes. They disappear
altogether, as well as any other "vision," upon an attempt
being made at seeing them with the external
surface of our eyes. Yet we may see inwardly with
our eyes open, as we do when absent-minded, etc.</p>

<p>If we could invent a microscope by the aid of
which we could look into ourselves in a <em>spiritual</em>
sense, that is, through posterior surfaces, <em>all</em> the
secret springs of our nature might be revealed to
us. This ability to become cognizant of physiologico-psychological
processes by the aid of the inner
surfaces of our organs of sense, reveals a peculiar
functional exercise of their faculties. In matters of
memory they are not intended to aid in conveying
to our consciousness impressions made at the <em>present</em>,
but those made at a previous time. These impressions
having been made on the soft tablets of our
brain, either during our individual existence or that
of our progenitors, and transmitted to us by dint of
heredity, are brought to our consciousness by the
aid of these inner surfaces, <em>phonographically</em>. They
are awakened by association; and that organ of sense
by the aid of whose anterior surface they were first
received and <em>recorded</em>, now reawakens them by the aid
of its posterior surface. Visions, consequently, are
reflections made on the inner surface of the eyes,
from impressions previously made upon the brain, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a similar manner to that by which sounds come forth
from a phonograph. They could not assume shape
if they were not thus reflected. It is owing to the
nature of these reflections that they are more fleeting
and evanescent than those made by the objects
themselves upon the external surface of the eyes.</p>

<p>The anterior and posterior surfaces of all organs,
by whose aid we exercise our faculties, which surfaces
represent their poles and dual factors, the
positive and the negative, the material and the
spiritual, change places in conformity with whether
an object is impressed upon them exteriorly or
interiorly, in the present or the past, directly or
indirectly, physically or spiritually. Things which
are brought to our consciousness from the exterior
world and in a direct manner&mdash;through our
senses&mdash;may be said to be of a <em>material</em> nature;
while those which come to us indirectly&mdash;through
our inner consciousness&mdash;may be said to be of <em>spiritual</em>
origin. The clearness of our visions naturally
depends upon the clearness of the impression still
remaining upon the tablets of the brain. The
more stirring the event in the first instance, the
deeper and more lasting, of course, the impression.
All this, however, does not throw any light upon
the process of abstract thought; nor am I in a position
to aid in so doing. Yet it appears to me to be
a sister proceeding; and that a nearer approach to
an explanation of those more material phenomena
may finally assist in arriving at an explanation of
the causes of these more recondite and apparently
purely spiritual phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The correctness of the preceding remarks will become
more apparent when we substitute for the
faculty of seeing, that of hearing. We hear the
voice of another person through the <em>anterior</em> part of
our ear, <em>entering</em>, as it does, from <em>without</em>. We hear
our own voice through the <em>posterior</em> part of our ear,
<em>going out</em>, as it does, from <em>within</em>. No matter how
low we may speak, we can always hear our own
voice, though inaudible to others; and we can still
distinctly hear it at such time, even when we fail to
hear a low, though in fact relatively much louder,
tone proceeding from the voice of another person.
A ventriloquist, on the other hand, with whom
these relations are reversed, hears his own voice reflected
from without, inwardly, while, if he continues
in the same condition while listening to
another person's voice, he will hear the latter from
within, outwardly.</p>

<p>For the purpose of testing the correctness of
these observations, please pay attention to the
following: In listening to the sounds of another
person's speech, you will have no difficulty in noticing
that they stream into your ear from without,
inwardly. Now, substitute for this other person's
voice the sounds of your own voice, <em>and continue to
listen to the same in precisely the same manner in
which you did to those of this other person</em>; that is,
let them flow into your ear from without, inwardly.
The result will be <em>that you will not only not hear the
sounds of your own voice, but that these sounds themselves
will become paralyzed, that you will not be able
to produce any sound whatever</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause is obvious. You attempt to listen to
negative sounds with the side of your ear still tuned
negatively; while, ordinarily, when we cease to
listen and commence to speak, <em>all</em> poles are reversed.
Spoken sounds are positive in relation to the speaker,
but negative in relation to the person listening to the
same. In consequence, the producer hears them
with the negative (inner) part of his ear, the receiver,
or listener, hears them with the positive
(exterior) part of his ear.</p>

<p>I copy the following from an article in the <cite>Philadelphia
Sunday Press</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A curious fact in regard to the effect of explosions
upon the drumhead, is that this tissue, though generally
blown in, is sometimes blown out. Just what causes the
latter result has not yet been fully explained."</p></div>

<p>In this instance, I presume, the person's ear was
tuned to listen interiorly, and the effect of the explosion,
which, in relation to him, was of a negative
nature, took effect on the positive, the posterior,
side of his ear. This person was not in expectancy
of the explosion, but it came on unawares, of a sudden,
while he was in a state of contemplation.</p>

<p>In connection with the eye, our inner consciousness
acts as a "rein" upon the outer, drawing back
in case of danger, checking our progress when suddenly
coming upon a precipice, and <em>regulating our
steps</em> to circumvent it, but without coming to a stop,
when seeing an obstacle in our way from a distance.
The "rein" in such an instance reverses the poles
of the eyes&mdash;the positive becomes negative and the
negative positive; that is to say, in our usual mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of seeing, while walking, the exterior surface of the
eye is positive, the interior negative; but when there
is danger ahead and we are warned to be cautious,
the exterior becomes negative and the interior positive;
the activity now being exercised by the latter,
the passivity by the former. The action of the
"rein," however, is not direct, but crosswise; that
is to say, the posterior surface of the left eye is in
correspondence with the anterior of the right, and
vice versa, in conformity with the "impulse"
emanating from either the one or the other, while
the anterior surface of the left eye is in correspondence
with the posterior of the right, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the reversion of the functional
exercise of our organs of sense is of signal importance
in connection with motion and vocal utterance,
which always go hand in hand; every utterance being
accompanied by a motion, though not always
visible to the eye. In truly artistic delivery these
motions are brought to the highest perfection; and
visibly, though often in great moderation, accompany
<em>every</em> inflection of the voice.</p>

<p>To be able to see a thing at all, we must be
in a relatively proper position with the object to be
seen; we must be on the same plane with it. We
must also have light, not only for the latter, but by
reflection therefrom also for ourselves. In addition
we must have the inner light enabling us to comprehend
what we have seen. I contend that for
the study of spiritual-material as well as material-spiritual
phenomena, such light has always been
wanting for the thing to be seen, as well as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the orb to see and consequently for the spirit to
comprehend. In attempting to comprehend, and
to explain appearances, physiologically, we have
been looking in our exterior world, where we
cannot, in place of our interior world, where we
might be able to see and to observe. We have
been using the outer surface of our eye instead of
the inner, with which to see spiritual things. The
thing to be seen and the orb with which to see
were not on the same "plane." It was impossible
to perform the act of <em>spiritually</em> seeing.
The proper light once obtained, it has not only
illumined for me the things to be seen, but also
my capacity for seeing and comprehending them.
Roentgen has taught us the method of seeing
material things through opaque bodies. I have
learned to recognize spiritual phenomena in opaque
bodies, created, as they are, by a combination of
spiritual and material factors. While I have made
use of this gift for a special study&mdash;that of vocal
utterance&mdash;I incline to think that it may be made
use of for the study of not only all the various
material-spiritual phenomena to be observed in the
nature of organic bodies in general and man's in
particular, but also of our relations with the unseen
and unknown world and its forces, in which our
essence has its being, whence it comes, and to which
it returns. In minutely explaining my mode of
proceeding, it is also my special desire to rob it of
any appearance of "supernaturalness" some persons
might be inclined to invest it with. Though
I cannot explain many things connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
voice from an entirely naturalistic standpoint, I
think they are all explainable if the proper amount
of study and observation be given to them. This,
as a matter of course, does not, however, include
the operations of the mind proper, which are governed
by laws beyond any human understanding.</p>


<h3>INSPIRATION&mdash;EXPIRATION</h3>

<p>The entire mechanism of our being, more especially
that of our faculties and functions, is primarily
excited through openings into which air is inspired,
from which air is expired. These openings are connected
with channels and vessels which are passive
or negative during inspiration; active or positive
during expiration. Thus the multiform streams of
air introduced into our system communicate with
parts thereof, which, by their construction and intercommunication
with others, are specially adapted
for the exercise of any special faculty or function.
Our will directs these streams of air to flow into
their proper channels (and they automatically obey)
for the guidance of our steps in a certain direction,
for the production of a given sound, the recognition
of a given sight, the sensation of a peculiar odor,
taste, or feeling, or the excitation of a passion,
a compassion, or any other sensation, feeling, or
thought whatsoever. These streams of air, therefore,
are of an order as multiform as the complex
web of our material and spiritual existence, and are
introduced through thousands of different channels
and in thousands of different ways.</p>

<p>To confine our mode of physical and spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
existence to a single stream of air introduced into
the oral cavity, or the nostrils, and thence into the
lungs, appears to me to be as primitive a proceeding
and as narrow a view as can possibly be taken of one
of the greatest subjects our understanding is called
upon to deal with. In place of that, I have positive
proof that the streams of air which flow into these
openings are of the most multiform nature; every
sight, odor, taste, touch, and every sound, and fraction
of a sound even, calling for a special stream of
air which no other stream can furnish or supply.
Besides the oral cavity and the nostrils, the eyes,
ears, and every additional opening, down to an
almost invisible pore or capillary vessel, are recipients
of special streams intended for special purposes. <em>We
breathe through the soles of our feet and the palms
of our hands, as well as through the skull of our heads.
The closer we guard our body against the influence
of the air, by means of unnaturally close-woven and
air-tight clothing, the less capable we become of exercising
our natural faculties and functions.</em></p>

<p>To this subject I shall devote time and attention
at some future period, more especially in connection
with vocal utterance, as it has everything to
do with the production of sounds, which proceed in
part from within, outwardly, and in part from without,
inwardly. In so doing, positive becomes negative
and negative positive; inspiration and expiration
equalize each other, and thus a continuous flow of
speech becomes possible, while if the flow were
continuously in one and the same direction it would
soon come to an absolute stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>It is this that science has done for us: It has
clogged up all these natural avenues to our existence
by teaching that we breathe through the trachea
alone, in consequence of the muscle of the diaphragm
forming an air-tight partition between the
upper and lower compartments of our bodies; being
ignorant of the fact of that other great tube of the
&#339;sophagus, also opening into the oral cavity, performing
the same functions for the abdomen which
the trachea does for the thorax. In place of all
these millions of openings through which we inspire
and expire, science teaches that we breathe through
a single tube, into and out of an <em>air-tight sack</em>,&mdash;a
mechanically impossible proceeding. By some ill-defined
process, air is supposed to find its way into
the thorax and out again after depositing its oxygen
in the blood-vessels. Meanwhile, the balance of our
body is left to shift for itself, not the slightest particle
of fresh food ever finding its way into any portion
thereof, except indirectly through the blood-vessels.
To my simple and untaught understanding it appears
that if such a state of affairs really existed&mdash;no matter
how rapid the circulation of the blood&mdash;the
entire hemisphere of the abdomen would be given
over to putrefaction in an exceedingly short space
of time.</p>

<p>Breathing, however, as we do, through the &#339;sophagus,
in like measure with the trachea, and through
every other opening in our epidermis in addition,
our body is constantly, uninterruptedly, permeated
with fresh air in its every avenue, vessel, capillary
tube, cell, etc., which sustains us by its life-giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
qualities, and takes away with it the constantly accumulating
refuse.</p>

<p>The muscle of the diaphragm has been the air-tight
door to the cell of the condemned, whose
portal has been guarded by ignorance and every
oppression, suppression, fear, superstition, anxiety,
bigotry, narrowness, prejudice, etc., that the human
mind is capable of. It has given us over to self-accusation
as a natural and vital element. It has
shut us up into the narrowest limits, and kept us
from communing with the universe and the spirit of
the universe. It has excluded from us the grace,
the beauty, the light, the liberty, the eternity of the
<em>spirit</em>, and prevented us from recognizing ourselves
as integral parts of the universe and of the causes
which sustain it and sustain us. It has prevented
us from communing with them as free agents <em>in our
own name and by our own right</em>, without interference
or the intercession of any person or agency whatsoever,
in the past or the present.</p>

<p>Have I placed too great a value on the discovery
of the "voice of the &#339;sophagus"?</p>

<p>I feel convinced that the further exposition of my
observations will justify me in all I have said.</p>


<h3>DIAPHRAGMS</h3>

<p>As the trunk has its diaphragm, dividing thorax
and abdomen, so do all dual hemispheres representing
a faculty or function have their diaphragms,
performing duties of an analogous nature. <em>Every</em>
opening, in fact, has its diaphragm. Where there
is none visible, it is formed by contraction, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ever
needed, and but for the time being. All these
various diaphragms, more particularly the one specially
bearing that name, are of the greatest importance
in connection with vocal utterance,&mdash;the sounds
of the vessels of the abdomen being produced by an
expansion of the thorax and consequent contraction
of the abdomen, those of the vessels of the thorax
by an expansion of the abdomen and a consequent
contraction of the thorax.</p>

<p>For the purposes of vocal utterance, inspiration
into the thorax produces an expiration from the
abdomen by way of the &#339;sophagus, accompanied
by vocal sound, while an inspiration into the abdomen
produces an expiration from the thorax by way
of the trachea, accompanied by vocal sound; the
special <em>mode</em> of inspiration regulating the special
sound to be produced.</p>

<p>This proceeding has reference to outgoing sounds
only. For ingoing sounds the opposite proceeding
takes place; an expiration from the thorax producing
an inspiration into the abdomen, and an expiration
from the abdomen an inspiration into the
thorax, both accompanied by sound. Every original
inspiration into thorax or abdomen, of course,
must have been preceded by an expiration from
these parts, while every original expiration must
have been preceded by an inspiration into the same.
The utterance of every sound, therefore, requires at
least three movements on the part of the respiratory
organs. But for the action of the diaphragm, such
sounds could not be produced.</p>

<p>All these various diaphragms fall or recede for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
inspiration, rise or advance for expiration; the
function of a diaphragm being exercised in conformity
with the manner in which it is approached.
This may be done by way of the &#339;sophagus or the
trachea, <em>i. e.</em>, from the side of the hemisphere of
the abdomen, or from that of the thorax. The
outward movement of the abdomen during respiration,
therefore, is not caused by a pressure
brought to bear on its contents by the diaphragm,
but it advances and recedes in conformity with a
direct process of inspiration and expiration by way
of the &#339;sophagus and the trachea; the &#339;sophagus
and trachea sustaining each other and acting reciprocally
and in conjunction. This presumed pressing
forward and subsequent receding of the entrails, in
consequence of the descent and ascent of the diaphragm,
presents a spectacle as repugnant as it
is impossible of execution; the extension of the
abdomen, more particularly in connection with
special sounds, being so great that no pressure
whatever brought to bear upon the entrails could
possibly produce it.</p>

<p>In place of this theory, now so generally entertained,
the simple fact obtains that the diaphragm
descends in consequence of an influx of air into and
subsequent expansion of the thorax, causing a contraction
of the abdomen and an efflux of air from
the same; that it ascends in consequence of an
influx of air into and expansion of the abdomen,
causing a contraction of the thorax and an efflux of
air from the same.</p>

<h2>IMPRESSION AND EXPRESSION</h2>


<p>All vocal expression is but an echo, the echo of
a thought. Thought <em>must</em> precede vocal expression.
It is not possible to produce a vocal
sound, not the simplest, without thought. There
is no such thing as a voice <em>ipso facto</em>, no more than
there is music in a musical instrument unless it is
called forth by the hand of the player. Try it.
Come upon a sound suddenly, around the corner,
as it were, and then express it. Do not give it a
moment's time for its development; that is, do not
give thought time to mould a form for it, but try
to utter it in embryo, so to say, the very moment
you think of it, and you will not be able to do it.
You will not produce any sound whatever.</p>

<p>It is as necessary to form a mould for a sound as
it is for any shaped and moulded material article.
Out of this mould it comes forth in conformity
with the form we have given it: harsh, abrupt,
discordant&mdash;rhythmical, beautiful, soulful. Such as
the thought is, so will be the expression. In ordinary
conversation this proceeding is automatic and
mechanical, in elocution or song more or less volitional
and artistic. That is to say, for ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
speech it acts automatically, for artistic utterance
it acts designedly. Materially, the mould is convex,
shut, for ingoing; concave, open, for outgoing
sounds. It expands for the former, it contracts for
the latter. Vocal sounds are a product of matter as
well as mind; the act itself which produces them
being a connecting link between matter and mind.
The soul calls on the body to aid it in giving form to
its desires and intentions; the body instantly obeys
and assumes the form from which the expected sound
or action is to arise.</p>

<p>No matter how great a soul may be, unless it can
give form and consequent utterance to its greatness,
it will be helpless, far more so than the simplest soul
capable of giving expression to its simplicity. Confined
to our own limits, like the congenital deaf, our
faculties become dwarfed and useless. We do not
know ourselves, do not know our own souls. We
must expand, go out into the world and take it in,
if we want to grow and give our faculties a chance
to develop.</p>

<p>The greater our horizon, the more we can take in,
the more we can give out. Our soul is scarcely ours
when enchained; the greater its liberty, the more it
belongs to us. Hence our just pity for the congenital
deaf, and our desire to assist them in their efforts
at expression. Those among them who are being,
or have been, tutored, receive their impressions
through their eyes in the form assumed by the
speaker's mouth; the eye assuming the function of
the ear. The form assumed by their teacher's mouth,
however, not being perfect, a perfect impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
cannot be made. Hence the expression of the deaf
is in conformity with the impression they have obtained:
mechanical, material, soulless. The exterior
lines of the mouth of the teacher, or any other
speaker's from which the deaf draw their inspiration,
are those of the material side of the medal. Failing
to see the reverse side thereof, namely, the interior
of the mouth, which is its spiritual side, the lines of
the latter make no impression upon them. These
fine lines on the interior side of the speaker's mouth,
representing the rhythm, the soul of the voice, not
being seen, fail to make that impression from which
alone a soulful expression could arise.</p>

<p>That an <em>impression</em> may be made through the eye
will scarcely require a defense, in view of the fact
that in reading aloud or in singing from notes the
<em>entire</em> impression is made through the eye. The
reader or singer, knowing the <em>value</em> of every sound,
is impressed by the sight of a letter or a note as he
would be by the sound itself. Not so with the congenital
deaf, who, being ignorant of such value, cannot
reproduce it. Nor will it be contended, I suppose,
that the deaf knowingly, designedly, or volitionally
attempt to imitate the forms assumed by the teacher's
mouth, but it will be admitted that this is done
spontaneously, and that vocal sounds with them
arise from this imperfect mechanism, thus involuntarily
reproduced.</p>

<p>With the congenital deaf, with persons attempting
to speak a foreign language, etc., the material
form, as well as the spiritual impetus, being imperfect,
the expression will be in conformity therewith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
In how far and in what manner these investigations
may become helpful to the deaf will be a matter for
the not distant future to develop. That they will
eventually become of the greatest aid to them I have
every reason to believe. Those who have made a
study of matters of this kind understand the difficulties
surrounding the same. These difficulties are
increased manifold where the ear of the scholar absolutely
refuses to come to his own and his teacher's
aid.</p>

<p>There are forms in which vocal sounds move,
well defined and capable of material representation,
which are not fully expressed by the shape of the
teacher's mouth, nor are they thus expressed by
impressions taken by the aid of the camera. Regarding
the latter, it is necessary to note that photographic
representations of vocal sounds are the result
of the combined action of the voice of the &#339;sophagus
and of that of the trachea, of material and immaterial
factors. Just in how far the latter are capable
of being thus represented must, as yet, remain a
matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>An attempt at reconciling photographic representations
of vocal sounds with the oscillations of the
vocal cords is, at most, a one-sided proceeding. To
arrive at any correct conclusion at all, it would be
necessary to take the vibrations of the "vocal lip"
and the fr&aelig;num into equal consideration.</p>

<p>Regarding our capacity for improving the natural
physical and psychical capabilities of the musical
instrument of the voice, that depends upon the
manner in which we play upon it. As it yields to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the slightest pressure of the air, either for good or
for evil, we must, above all things, learn how to
guide the tip of our tongue in touching its a&euml;rial
strings or keys, which are far more sensitive than
those of any instrument ever produced by the hand
of man. It takes years to attain a mastery over the
simplest musical instrument; yet it is often expected
that the instrument of the voice should yield to the
most careless efforts made in the most wilful and
indiscriminate manner.</p>

<p>The <em>thought</em> of a sound, after <em>producing</em> an impression,
<em>guides</em> the tongue in <em>releasing</em> such impression.
Unless the tongue touches or moves towards the
exact spot which will effect such release, the expression
or the sound will not be forthcoming. That the
impression, as well as its release, should be properly
made, it is necessary to <em>think</em> of the sound which
is to be produced, in the most precise and correct
manner. I cannot sufficiently impress upon the
reader's mind the importance this simple lesson
conveys. If he will shape his manner of vocal utterance,
especially his mode of singing, in conformity
therewith, he will be able to improve his voice to a
far greater extent than he would by following any
or all of the realistic methods now in vogue. This
<em>thinking</em> of the correct sound must be carried on for
the <em>next</em> syllable during the <em>production</em> of the previous
one; and care must be taken not to think of
more than one syllable at one and the same time.
Unless this is done, no pure sound will ever be
produced, the impression made by thinking of a
second or third syllable overlapping that for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
next following; thus producing a muddle and a
discord. Rhythm being the basis for all perfect
vocal utterance, a rhythmic impression must be
made in order to obtain a rhythmic expression.
This cannot be done when the former is not preserved
in its entire purity until it is released.</p>

<p>All of us, either during our ordinary speech or
during our efforts at artistic expression, are guided
by the process just described; unknowingly, unwittingly,
properly or improperly, for good or for
evil, pursuing this same course. I cannot enter
upon these matters to any greater extent at this
time, as it will be necessary to first treat of other
matters with which they are intimately connected.</p>


<h3>THE PHONOGRAPH</h3>

<p>In trying the experiment of coming upon a sound
unawares, simply endeavor to divest yourself of all
thought, and then suddenly, without any preparation
whatever, say "a," or "b," or "it," or any word
you wish, and you will not be able to produce such
sound or sounds&mdash;or, in fact, any sound whatsoever.
Or, you may get some one to, of a sudden, produce
sounds embodied in letters before your eyes; and
you will find you will be unable to utter them instantly.
While you cannot thus produce a vocal
sound, or vocal sounds embodied in words, you can
produce <em>simple</em> sounds without preparation. As
they belong to but one hemisphere, and are consequently
not the product of a compound impression,
they may be uttered the very moment we think of
them. While they are being uttered, our organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of speech are "shut," far more so than they are for
<em>vocal</em> sounds.</p>

<p>Consonant sounds cannot be uttered "vocally"
without a vowel sound. When they appear in a
syllable their <em>accompanying</em> vowel sound carries them
and permeates them. When they appear singly we
add a vowel sound to them. We say: "ar," "be,"
"en," "ka," etc.; unless we do so we cannot pronounce
them. Without such accompanying vowel
sound they would be inert.</p>

<p>"Simple" <em>consonant</em> sounds are unaccompanied,
not "leavened," by a vowel sound. "Simple" <em>vowel</em>
sounds, on the other hand, are unaccompanied by
the element which constitutes consonant sounds;
while "vocal" <em>vowel</em> sounds <em>are</em> accompanied
thereby.</p>

<p>The word "surd," used in connection with non-vocal
sounds, does not express the meaning of what
I call "simple" sounds, as all sounds may be either
"vocal" or "simple," while "surd" applies only
to special sounds.</p>

<p>The necessity of making an impression for vocal
utterance also prevails in connection with motion.
You cannot lift your right foot or your left arm, or
make any given motion whatever, the very moment
you think of making it. It requires some preparation;
though you may lift <em>part</em> of a limb without
preparation. A part of a limb in this sense may be
compared to a <em>simple</em>, the entire limb to a <em>vocal</em>,
sound. The thought must make an impression by expansion
or contraction, which, when released, will
express the desired motion; no matter whether such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
motion is made unconsciously or deliberately. It is
more difficult to watch this proceeding in connection
with sight; the operations of light being so rapid
that the expression seems to be simultaneous with
the impression.</p>

<p>Contraction and expansion for motion are of the
same order as they are for vocal utterance. In
fact, both are so closely connected that we cannot
utter a sound unless it is accompanied by a motion.
In stopping the motion accompanying a sound, we
stop our ability of uttering such sound. I shall
have occasion to call attention to numerous conditions
under which it will be impossible to utter
sounds, either separate or connected, by stopping
the motion necessary to produce such sounds. It
is all due to the fact that we are homogeneous
beings, <em>whose powers are interdependent upon one
another</em>.</p>

<p>The effect of the teacher's <em>voice</em> upon his or her
scholar's organization is of a <em>similar</em> order to that
made by <em>thought</em> upon the teacher's own organization.
That it is not of the <em>same</em> order is due to the
fact that the organization upon which it is made is
but rarely constituted the same, is not as highly
organized and developed or "schooled," as the one
from which the voice emanated. The impression
made by the singing-teacher's <em>voice</em> is of the same
order as that made upon the deaf by the <em>features</em> of
their instructor which are representative of his voice.
We are living, breathing <em>phonographs</em>. Every impression
we receive through any of our senses must
be made in a material manner before it can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
its immaterial expression. We engrave upon living
tissue, instead of on rubber or wax.</p>

<p>I repeat that, to obtain a pure sound, the <em>thought</em>
underlying such sound or sounds must be <em>purely,
clearly defined</em>. We cannot obtain a clear impression
from a seal whose engraving is blurred, or when the
sealing-wax is not in a proper condition of softness,
or when the hand is not steady which makes the
impression. The same conditions prevail with vocal
utterance. Thought makes the impression; the
&aelig;ther, passing through its narrowed passages at a
rate as swift as thought, creates the sound. The
impression is made as <em>thought</em> progresses, the expression
as <em>sound</em> progresses. While the <em>impression
is thoughtful, the expression is thoughtless</em>. While
we think for a sound during the impression, we do
not think for it during its expression; <em>but we think,
during the latter, for the next sound</em>. If this were
not the case, consecutive speech would be a matter
of impossibility. The artist's thought is embodied
in the creation of the model for his statue from
which a mould is made. The casting of the statue,
equal to its expression, is mechanical, thoughtless.</p>

<p>In this connection the brain is of the same order
as the tablets of the phonograph. For ordinary use,
however, the lines engraved upon it are evanescent;
they disappear again with the sound or thought
which releases them. Impressions, however, of a
deeper nature remain&mdash;some forever. The thought
or sounds they represent, the same as the lines on the
tablets of the phonograph, are released but for the
time being and while such thought and sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
(through association) are recalled to memory. The
thought and sounds are evanescent, but the lines
which represent them remain for further use, the
same as the lines on the tablets of the phonograph
and the strings of a musical instrument. If we
could read aright the lines which the voice makes
on the tablets of the phonograph or on the negative
plates of the photographer, we would obtain a correct
insight into their character. These studies,
when fully developed, may lead to a comprehension
of these hieroglyphics, the same as the Greek translation
on the Rosetta stone furnished the cue to the
comprehension of the hieroglyphics of the Egyptian
monuments.</p>


<h3>STUTTERING, STAMMERING</h3>

<p>What is all this I am writing?</p>

<p>It is an endeavor at giving expression to an impression
obtained of a great subject imperfectly
understood. The general ideas underlying it all are
on the lines of truth, but the contours are evanescent,
the lines representing special features ill-defined,
while the finer shadings are almost entirely
wanting. It is a stuttering, a stammering, in matters
my mind is too narrow to grasp, incapable of comprehending
in all their bearings, impotent to take in
in their ultimate relations. Still, I am doing what I
can with such material as nature has placed at my disposal.
Thought failing to make a clear impression,
my pen, I fear, cannot give a clear expression to it all.</p>

<p>Regarding the subject of stuttering proper, I must
still preface it with some remarks of a general nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
The influx and efflux of streams of air into and out
of our system, called breathing, is of a very complicated
nature. While we designate the same by
the general terms of inspiration and expiration, these
streams are of as multiform a nature as the ethereal
fabrics they are intended to weave, whose weft they
form, and whose warp is of a more material nature.
Call these fabrics what you please&mdash;actions, speech,
feelings, passions, fancies, sensations, etc. While
these streams form innumerable separate systems,
they are all subject to one and the same law&mdash;rhythm.
The more perfect the rhythm the higher the development
and consequent performance.</p>

<p>While we always breathe, or should breathe, in
the same rhythmic order (the octave) for the sustenance
of life in general, we unconsciously breathe
in various other measures for an endless number of
other purposes. Our dual nature, and the duality of
the manner in which we breathe, as a rule enable
us to go through these various performances without
a disturbance as to the harmonious character of
our existence. It is a great orchestral performance
by instruments of various kinds and orders, each
performer playing his own notes, specially adapted
to his particular part and instrument; yet all coming
together in one harmonious <em>ensemble</em>. This fact
finds expression, clearly defined, in the various
measures in which metre and rhythm are clad for
poetry and song. The introduction into our system
of a rhythmic flow of streams of air for the various
purposes of vocal utterance is conditioned upon a
rhythmic flow of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>To perfectly render a poetical conception by words
either spoken or sung, the performer's <em>mind</em> must be
in accord with the rhythm underlying such conception.
In that case only will he breathe and, consequently,
speak or sing in the requisite manner for
such production. I should have prefaced all this by
saying that, in the same manner as inspiration and
expiration succeed each other in regular rotation, so
do the ordinary measures of long and short (&macr;&#728;),
or short and long (&#728;&macr;), in simple forms of poetry,
succeed each other in regular rotation; long (&macr;),
or stress, always standing for expiration, short (&#728;),
or repose, for inspiration. <em>As a matter of fact,
however, inspiration is of longer duration than expiration.</em></p>

<p>All other forms are artistic, and are produced by
a mode of thinking, and consequent breathing, as
variable as the subject may suggest or demand.
For ordinary speech, while the rhythm is not of the
same order as that for poetry, a rhythmic order of
some kind must be, and always is, observed. That
the rhythm is not noticeable is due to the fact that,
while inspiration and expiration in prose writing
and ordinary conversation follow each other in
regular rotation, they are not always accompanied
by sound. Hence the rhythmic irregularities
of speech exist only in appearance and in the inartistic
manner in which speech is generally, and
prose writing often, produced. A person who
speaks and writes his language <em>well</em>, speaks and
writes it rhythmically, always. Good style is
synonymous with correct rhythmical expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
superinduced by correct breathing; rhythmic expression
depending entirely upon rhythmic impression,
and the latter upon rhythmic thought,
accompanied by rhythmic breathing.</p>

<p>To write well (that is, a good style), to speak well
(as an orator, actor, or elocutionist), to sing well, it
is, above all things, necessary that the performer's
mind should be in a state of conformity with the
situation which is to be described. His flow of
thought, and consequent breathing and mode of
expression, will then correspond with the scope,
drift, and circumstance underlying his performance.
Unless this is the case, the latter will be unsatisfactory,
unimpressive, unsympathetic. To prove that
for a satisfactory performance this <em>must</em> be the case,
it will but be necessary to call attention to the fact
that under various emotions our mode of breathing
undergoes great changes&mdash;as under fear, hate,
jealousy, indignation, excitement, love, enthusiasm,
benevolence, languor, apathy, etc. Our breathing
under these different circumstances will, the
same as the manner of our expression, undergo
various stages of change as to time and measure, as
well as to rhythm, emphasis and intonation.</p>

<p>The character and rapidity of the flow of our
blood is of the same order as our manner of breathing.
It is, in fact, as I expect to prove later on,
not only of the same order, but of the same origin
and regulated by the same causes. The flow of the
blood is not merely of a material order, but of a
spiritual one as well. While it is acted upon by the
mind it reacts upon the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought must be measured and restricted as
to time, so as to enable it to make the proper impression
and produce a corresponding expression
<em>before</em> another thought comes along crowding in
upon the preceding one and in so doing <em>blurring</em>
the impression made by the latter before it had
been given the time to be expressed. If the necessary
time is not granted for an impression to be
made and for the expression thereof to obliterate
the same, the premature flow of another thought,
coming on top of the first, will make a new impression
over the previous one, causing confusion and
making a clear expression a matter of impossibility.
Unless our professor, while standing in front of his
blackboard demonstrating before his class, has a
sponge in his hand, and before again writing in the
same place wipes out that which he had written
before, the new writing will not be of such a nature
that it can be understood. The slate endures; but
the thought and the writing are always new. Yet,
when such writing is of an <em>impressive</em> nature, it is like
that of a palimpsest; though apparently obliterated,
its lines remain, and their meaning can be recalled
to memory as often as the occasion may demand it.</p>

<p>The "muddle" of which I have spoken is oftentimes
so great that no sound of any kind can ensue,
the rhythmic flow of sound-producing streams having
been disturbed and prevented from assuming
the necessary shape for their formation into proper
sound-waves by this hasty mode of thinking. The
consequence is a hiatus in the natural flow of speech,
which prevents the thought from materializing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the shape of the word intended to be spoken. This
hiatus the victim of such precipitate mode of thinking
generally attempts to bridge over by spasmodic
efforts, which but serve to aggravate the situation,
increasing, as they do, the disorder in the sound-producing
lines.</p>

<p>Stuttering being caused by a disorder in these
lines, the remedy is to again restore them to order.
The disorder having been caused by a too hasty
mode of thinking, superinduced, as a rule, by a desire
<em>not</em> to stutter, or a <em>fear</em> of stuttering, the remedy
lies in allaying this fear. The fear of stuttering, or
the anxiety not to stutter, which obtains while the
speaker is producing thought, <em>itself being thought</em>,
and coming on top of the thought intended to be
uttered, brings about, or at least aggravates, the
very difficulty he was trying to overcome. Mere
thought may wander off and again return to its
theme, unrestrained, and without causing disturbance;
but thought which is to be <em>vocally</em> uttered
must strictly adhere to its subject. There is no impression
to be made by the former which must
remain until it is released by vocal sound; impression
and expression being almost simultaneous. In
place of making a spasmodic effort, therefore, the
stutterer should endeavor to be calm, and to then
calmly <em>think</em> the word or sentence over again which
has become a stumbling-block in his way. After
doing so, he will have no trouble uttering it.</p>

<p>The fact that stutterers experience no difficulty in
singing is a proof of the correctness of these assertions.
While singing, the performer's streams of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and organs of speech are all <em>tuned</em> to one harmonious
measure. His frame of mind being securely in accord
with his theme, his thought, devoid of fear,
flows evenly along with his song. There is no occasion
for haste or trepidation in this instance,&mdash;there
cannot be, haste being the opposite to and the
enemy of harmony, the latter meaning a continuous
return of the same measure and the same mode of
breathing, the former irregularity and disorder in
the mode of breathing.</p>

<p>Besides, song, belonging to the pharynx, is spiritual;
it is of our inner nature, and therefore restful
and continuous. While speech, which belongs to the
oral cavity, is material; it is of our outer nature,
and therefore subject to every impression, influence,
and consequent change. Elocution, declamation,
or recitation, on the other hand, partake of both
our inner and our outer nature. They belong in
part to the pharynx and in part to the oral cavity.</p>

<p>Experiments may be made by means of making
these respective parts rigid which will establish the
correctness of these assertions.</p>

<p>These experiments can also be made by the application
of mechanical pressure. When pressing
your hand or fingers against your throat you will be
unable to speak, though it will not prevent you
from singing. By pressing them against the back
of your neck you will be unable to sing, though
you may speak. By pressing them against either
side of your neck you will be unable to recite,
though you may both speak and sing. The slightest
pressure, even, will produce these results. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
me remark, however, that unless the <em>thought</em> of the
performance accompanies it, a mere mechanical pressure
will not suffice.</p>

<p>That <em>thought</em>, improperly exercised, is the cause of
stuttering or stammering, obtains from the fact,
that the utterance of the singer, elocutionist or
actor, being a matter of memory, and not of original
thought, is <em>not</em> subject to these troubles; though
the utterance of the same persons while speaking,
and in so doing, <em>thinking</em>, may be subject thereto.</p>

<p>Not appreciating its significance, I used to laugh
with everybody else at the anecdote of a stuttering
boy in an apothecary shop, who had been sent down
after some article in the cellar. Returning, pale,
trembling, and <em>stammering</em>, his master cried out,
"Sing, sing!" whereupon he delivered himself
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Der spiritus im keller brennt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und alles steht in flammen."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">("The spirits, master, are aflame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all things are a-burning.")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a recent number of <cite>Cosmopolis</cite>, Prof. Max
M&uuml;ller said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Charles Kingsley was a great martyr to stammering,
and it was torture to him to keep conversation waiting
until he could put his thoughts into words. Singularly
enough, at church, Kingsley did not stammer at all in
reading or speaking; but on his way home from church
he would say to one with whom he was walking: 'Oh,
let me stammer now; you won't mind it!'"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>While his thoughts were concentrated on his subject,
which had probably been elaborated beforehand
and was expressed in rhythmic language,
besides being obliged to speak slowly and deliberately
so as to be heard and understood, he experienced
no difficulty. Still, he was under a restraint.
As soon as he was by himself again, he commenced
to think impulsively, as probably was his habit, and
gave vent to a torrent of thoughts, which overleaped
each other like waters rushing through a broken
dam.</p>

<p>There are two main forms in which this trouble
manifests itself. The one is a surfeit, a crowding
together of sounds, all of which want to come to
the surface at one and the same time, like a crowd
of people during a panic trying to rush out through
the same door, thus causing a jam. This form,
creating a hiatus in vocal utterance, is generally
designated by the term "stammering." That
which is called "stuttering," on the other hand,
consisting, as it does, in a repetition of the same
sound, is due to the opposite cause. While the
former is due to too great an effort, this is due to a
paucity of effort. The sound-furnishing element is
not under control; it leaks out against the will, it
runs away with you. Hence a repetition of the
form once assumed, in consequence of a lack of
nerve force, of a rein to keep it in check, of a brake
preventing it from rushing down-hill with you; in
contradistinction to the act of stammering, in which
the brake had been too forcibly applied, the watch
wound up too firmly and beyond its requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of stammering the impression has
been too quick in shaping itself into words; in the
other it has been too slow in so doing. In the
former case too many moulds have been formed for
proper impression; while in the latter the sound is
spoken before the mould has been properly and <em>completely</em>
formed; that part only which had been formed
being uttered and repeated. In the case of stammering
there is a surfeit of impression but a want of
sound; in that of stuttering there is a want of impression
but a surfeit of sound. A stammerer is
one who takes in too much, a stutterer one who
takes in too little, air for his hasty way of thinking.</p>

<p>When this trouble happens with one and the
same person&mdash;as it sometimes does&mdash;it first assumes
one shape and then the other; it turns a complete
somersault in so doing. The balance, the equilibrium,
the point of gravitation, previously overleaped
on one side, is again overleaped, and the
person lands on its extreme other side. While a
stammerer he had too much ballast on board, now
he has too little.</p>

<p>A stammerer can return to the point of gravitation
by throwing some of his surplus ballast overboard.
<em>His tongue being tied to his lower jaw, in which
position he is constantly taking in more air than he
needs, he must raise it in order to let the surplus out
from beneath the same.</em></p>

<p>A stutterer, whose tongue is running away with
him, owing to an insufficiency of ballast, must take
in enough (inspire sufficiently) to bring him back to
his point of gravitation. <em>His tongue is in a loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
state of elevation, in which position the air is constantly
streaming out (expiring) from beneath the
same.</em> He must <em>lower</em> it to have <em>his</em> balance restored,
as in so doing the air will stream in over
and above the tongue until the equilibrium has been
restored. In other words, the person who is thus
agitated must calm himself, he must relax from an
overstrain in either one direction or the other. The
diaphragm, holding the balance of power, will be
found to be in as uncontrollable a condition as the
tongue, <em>with which it always acts in unison</em>. In restoring
the tongue to a normal condition we restore
the diaphragm to a normal condition.</p>

<p>The institutions for the cure of stuttering, stammering,
and intermediate stages of the same trouble,
attempt to bring about a state of restoration of the
disturbed balance by means arrived at through
experience. The real cause being unknown, the
remedies must necessarily be restricted. If persons
thus afflicted will take their own cases in hand and
treat them in conformity with the precepts here laid
down, the chances are in favor of their being cured
where no other remedy had been of any avail.</p>

<p>As the preceding remarks have been made from
the point of view of an English-speaking person, the
standpoint of a German being diametrically opposite,
the same must all be reversed to fit the case of
a German, in so far as locality is concerned. <em>For
stammering, the tongue of a German is closely wedged
in, in the direction of the roof of the mouth; for stuttering,
it is loosely pointing downward.</em> This is owing
to the fact that a German inspires from under and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
beneath, and expires from over and above, his
tongue; just the reverse of the manner in which
this is done by an English-speaking person.</p>

<p>In order to efficiently cure the trouble of stuttering,
it is necessary that the act of breathing and
sound-production should be closely studied with
every separate nationality, as these processes differ
with all nationalities; this difference being very pronounced
as between Germans and Anglo-Saxons.
For an American to go to Germany, therefore, to
be cured of this trouble, is as false a step as for a
German to go to the United States or England for
this purpose.</p>

<p>While I have in the preceding endeavored to give
an account of the general causes which result in
stuttering, I have not touched upon such special
causes as are directly connected with the character
and origin of vocal sounds; the explanation of
which must be postponed to a future period.</p>


<h3>THE CATHODE OF A VOCAL SOUND</h3>

<p>By an accident, in some respects not unlike the
one which drew Roentgen's attention to the light
by whose aid we have learned to look into and
through opaque bodies, I (myself an accident, an
appearance on and soon to be a disappearance from
the illuminated surface of the earth) have discovered
eternal laws, by whose aid we shall be able to comprehend
much of what has heretofore been as a
closed book to us, regarding our physical and psychical
nature and the exercise of our faculties and
functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>During my endeavors to overcome the difficulties
which my German tongue offered to the perfect
pronunciation of the English "r" sound, and during
an almost frantic effort on one occasion at so doing,
I was amazed by the fact that while one "r" came
to the surface from over and above the tongue,
another made its appearance from under and beneath
the same. The latter was the "r" of the
voice of the &#339;sophagus. Of all this, however, I
have spoken at length in my previous publication.</p>

<p>Though it occurred to me at once like a flash that
this was a revelation of the greatest importance, its
real significance was only made clear to me in the
course of time. No matter how I view it, as time
progresses it assumes greater and greater proportions.
There is no event in the history of man
which appears to me to be of greater significance.
Through this "accident" I was induced to look
closer and closer into my inner nature, where, to
my amazement, I found that a world, apparently
silent and mysterious, and supposed to be unapproachable,
was the abode of numberless physical
and psychical phenomena, clearly defined and
definable.</p>

<p>The "r" which came to the surface from beneath
my tongue by way of the &#339;sophagus was the cathode,
the negative end of this sound. The <em>product</em>
of its combination with the <em>simple</em> "r" (which came
to the surface from over and above the tongue by
way of the trachea) I had hitherto produced when
attempting to speak English, was the <em>vocal</em> "r"
sound of the English language; the "r" I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hitherto produced having been the anode&mdash;the positive
and first part of this sound only. As Roentgen's
cathodic light has illuminated the physical
body, so have cathodic sounds illumined for me
the spiritual body of my mundane existence. I am
endeavoring to show my fellowmen this "new light,"
whose lustre, also invisible on ordinary occasions,
when once seen is so great that it will never again
fade from the memory of the beholder. As time
progresses, it will continue to penetrate ever more
deeply into regions hitherto considered to be impervious
to any kind of light; regions whose phenomena
have been called supernatural, or, at least,
beyond the sphere of the knowledge of man. All
other anodes or cathodes of which we have obtained
any knowledge belong to physical phenomena only.
The cathode I have discovered belongs to our
spiritual life, being a part of a living vocal sound.</p>

<p>Think of it! To be able to divide the essence of
life and to obtain two <em>living</em> parts, each endowed
with a life of its own! This is a nearer approach to
the knowledge of life than any ever attained before.
A <em>vocal</em> sound is an entity. From entities we cannot
learn anything. They are phenomena complete
in themselves. Regarding their innermost nature,
they have always been to us as a closed book. They
offer us no vantage-ground; no opening, no breach,
through which we can enter into the mysterious
process of their existence. No matter whether such
life or existence be that of the minutest parasite of
a minute vegetable growth, that growth itself, or
the giant of the forest; whether it be that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
microbe or the microbe of a microbe; whether it be
the essence of a thought, a sigh, a tear, a look, a
vocal sound, or of a human being&mdash;their innermost
natures are all alike mysterious to us. I have
succeeded in analyzing a vocal sound, and this apparently
simple proceeding has opened up to me
endless vistas in endless directions. I have reduced
this entity into its natural elements, and have again
put these together. After resolving it into two lives
I have again formed it into one. I can bring about
this analysis as well as this synthesis at will at any
time.</p>

<p>All know what is meant by vocal sounds, yet few,
I repeat, know what are simple sounds, though constantly
used by everybody while whispering or uttering
exclamations, while surprised, alarmed, frightened,
etc. My accomplishment, therefore, is but
the <em>recognition</em> of the nature of a thing constantly
before us and brought to our consciousness through
our ear.</p>

<p>Simple sounds are the anodes, the beginnings of
sounds. There is no life in them, no rhythm, no
melody, no light, no grace, no beauty. These are
imparted to them by the fusion of the cathode element
of vocal sounds with this, the anode; the
spiritual with the material. The anode is formed
first. It is the passive element, the female, the
patient, the waiting, which must have been before
the male, the impatient, the aggressive. The thing
to be fructified must have been before that which
fructifies.</p>

<p>The anode is quiescent until the cathode comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
along, joins it, and infuses life into it. The creation
of a vocal sound is an act of generation. The
cathode, after overwhelming the anode, penetrates
it and diffuses itself throughout it, and thus forms
a union whose result is the production of a vocal
sound. Similar unions between anodes and cathodes
are formed a myriad-fold every moment during
time's progress, and result in the creation of an
electric spark, or a succession of sparks, called an
electric light, or any other light or fire, or of a
thought, or of the embryo to a new life of any and
every description, etc.; while a discord, a stutter,
a <em>smouldering</em> fire, the sight of a thing too dimly
seen to be recognized, a cut or broken limb, a
suspense, a disappointment, a <em>suppressed</em> action or
passion, etc., are anodes not joined by their cathodes.
By the juncture of a cathode with an anode
we exercise our faculties, we become conscious of a
sight, a sound, an odor, a taste, etc.; the anode
being vested in the thing to be seen, heard, smelled,
or tasted,&mdash;the cathode in ourselves.</p>

<p><em>While the anode of a vocal sound may be uttered
audibly, the cathode, by itself, cannot be uttered&mdash;the
spiritual cannot be materialized except in conjunction
with the material.</em> The anode, the physical, is inert
until the cathode, the spiritual, has formed a juncture
with it, has been alloyed with it. Every phenomenon
of which we become conscious is the result
of a process of this nature. The more perfect the
union, the more perfect the outcome or result, the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>In our ordinary speech this alloy, this union, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of a mutable and evanescent, in oratory and song
it is of a more continuous and lasting, nature.
With persons speaking a foreign tongue, and with
the deaf, it is superficial, imperfect; in many cases,
in fact, we hear only anodes, no union having been
effected. The amalgamation, the alloy of the finer
with the coarser, the higher with the lower, the
spiritual with the material, is not at all or but imperfectly
performed; the coarser element prevails
and makes its presence felt in every utterance. The
more perfect the union between anodes and cathodes
in vocal utterance, the higher will be the performance,
the more perfect the speech, the more beautiful
the song, the more stirring, the more soulful; the
nearer they come to our hearts.</p>

<p>How do I know all this? I will tell you: By
watching the <em>beginning</em> of a vocal sound; the performance
actually going on within us, while such sound
is first being created. This performance is of an inverse
order as between German and English, in so
far as the anode for German vocal sounds is located
to the right, the cathode to the left. The cathode
approaches the anode from left to right; while in
the creation of an English vocal sound the anode is
to the left, the cathode to the right, and the latter
approaches the former from right to left. The location
where the union <em>appears</em> to take place is in the
chest, near the heart; for German sounds, to the
right thereof, for English to the left. As a matter
of fact, however, it is in the heart itself.</p>

<p>What does the motion in which anode and cathode
approach each other&mdash;which is not direct as it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
first appears to the observer, but vastly circuitous&mdash;signify?</p>

<p>The circulation through the vascular system of the
elements (of the &aelig;ther) creating vocal sounds, or the
<em>circulation of vocal sounds</em>. The proofs that this important
fact actually obtains will be furnished very
positively and very circumstantially at a later date
in connection with that part of these expositions
which treats on vocal sounds.</p>

<h2>OUR MOTHER TONGUE</h2>


<p>Nature will have its right always. What is
this right in regard to vocal utterance? It is
the manner in which we breathe. When we violate
nature's right in our mode of breathing for vocal
expression, our penalty is that such expression will
not be what it is intended to be, what it should be;
the idiomatic expression of every language being the
outcome of a special mode of breathing for the same.</p>

<p><em>All</em> my observations in the first instance owe their
origin to the fact that I was breathing in a manner
directly opposite to the one in which it was necessary
for me to breathe to correctly produce the idiomatic
expression of the English language. It was not until
after this fact had become clear to my mind that I
began to extract from my organs of speech those
sounds which appear so abnormally different and
"strange" to the ear of the bewildered foreigner,
who finds himself completely at a loss how to produce
them. The better he becomes acquainted with
the language, the more thoroughly he becomes convinced
of the fact that his mode of speaking English
is different from that of the native-born. Nor will
a German <em>ever</em> succeed in speaking English as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
should be spoken until he succeeds in <em>reversing</em> his
mode of breathing. He must go straight to the
antipodes in sound production; he must stand on
his head, so to say, instead of on his feet. I shall
fully explain what this means later on.</p>

<p>I venture to make the assertion that no other
person besides myself has ever learned to pronounce
a foreign language <em>idiomatically correct</em>, as I have,
by means of applying to his mode of speaking rules
based on actual knowledge or scientific principles.
In this manner I have succeeded in learning to speak
English with less of the tinge of a foreign accent
adhering to my speech than usually is the case
with foreigners who have commenced to speak it
as late in life as I did. I do not say this vauntingly,
for I do not consider this accomplishment in itself
as of a very high order; but I say it to vindicate my
claim that I have discovered the principles on which
the production of language is based, and offer my
personal pronunciation of the English language to
which these principles have been applied as a proof
that I have done so. I am still learning, however,
for it takes time and practice and a great deal of
patience to dislodge the old habit from its wonted
haunts and to assign its quarters to a foreign guest.
My old familiar dwelling has thus become a lodging
for the English language, though I can return to it
at will with my old and dearly beloved mother
tongue and be comfortable therein.</p>

<p>The foreign guest, however, who came to dwell
therein, does not use my native home, in his mode
of entering it or going forth from it, in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
familiar way, nor does he use the same apartments
for the same purposes. He enters at the back gate
while I used to enter at the front; he leaves it at
the front gate while I left at the back. He opens
his shutters to the east, while I used to look out
from the west, etc. Such differences as these in
our mode of breathing exist throughout the entire
length and breadth of both languages. The sounds
we have imbibed in our early youth, however, will
always be more familiar and nearer to us and dearer
than those of any other language, no matter how
closely the latter may enter into our lives and our
being at a later period.</p>


<h3>NATIONAL TRAITS OF CHARACTER</h3>

<p>What constitutes a given number of people a
nation, besides their history, their political organization,
and the geographical position of their territory?
What makes every member belonging to a nation,
whether he lives within its territory or has emigrated
therefrom, a different being from every member of
any other nation? What makes each member of a
nation resemble every other member thereof, not
only in regard to vocal expression but also in regard
to general cast of features, build of body, movements,
gesticulations, etc., and in what may be
summed up as national traits of character?</p>

<p>No one will deny the fact that such differences
exist, as between Germans, Frenchmen, and Englishmen,
for instance. This difference is not racial,
as they all belong to the Caucasian race. It can
scarcely be climatic with nations whose territory is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
adjacent to each other; nor is it likely to be religious,
historical, or political. There is nothing
very decidedly different in the situation and composition
of these various nations and the individuals
of which they are composed, except their <em>language</em>.</p>

<p>I maintain that language is not only the main
point of difference, but that it is the cause and
origin of all other main points of difference. As
language is the main gift which distinguishes men
from animals, so it is also the principal distinguishing
mark as between one nation and another. I
maintain, and expect to prove, that the language&mdash;that
is, any specific language&mdash;acquired in childhood
becomes an integral part of a person's organization,
as positively so as any of his other natural faculties;
and that he cannot change it, that is, <em>in an idiomatically
correct manner</em>, without changing, to some
extent, the drift of his entire organism. As soon
as I began to succeed in speaking the English
language as it is spoken in this country, idiomatically
correct, I changed my nature, to some extent,
from that of a German to that of an American; nor
is it possible to learn to speak any language idiomatically
correct without undergoing a similar
change. Not alone my mode of vocal expression,
but my motions, my habits, nay, my very <em>features</em>,
yes, even my way of <em>thinking</em>, in some respects, have
been subjected to such a change; modified, of course,
by heredity, previous habits, and the constant reversion
of all this by the frequent recurrence to my
native tongue. In using the term "idiomatically
correct" I mean of course that mode of expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
which is peculiar to a language, its general cast, and
which is representative of its genius and spirit.</p>

<p>To what do I attribute so powerful an influence?</p>

<p>It is not easy to say this comprehensively in a
few words. I will say this much, however: That,
language being the outcome of streams of the vital
fluid passing into and out of our composition in a
systematic manner, each system varying with every
other system, our vital organs are differently affected,
in conformity with the manner and the rotation in
which these streams reach these different organs;
in other words, in conformity with the manner in
which we breathe for our language. This influence
is not confined to the vocal expression of a <em>nation</em>. It
is influential with and extends to the special mode
of vocal expression in separate districts, provinces,
localities, and cities; nay, it extends to families and
single members belonging to such families, each
separate member's expression being the product of
his special mode of breathing, and differing in some
respects from that of every other member of the
same family; <em>such difference in the mode of breathing
being the reflection of every individual soul</em>.</p>

<p>The bent of the soul in <em>individual</em> cases determines
the flow of these streams, the same as the
bent of the <em>national</em> soul determines the same for
the entire nation. Or, which perhaps would be
more correct, the flow of these streams determines
the bent of the individual as well as national soul.
The influence being reciprocal, it would be difficult
to state, as it is with all matters of this kind, <em>which</em>
preponderates, <em>which</em> gives the first impulse. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the same order as the old question (never to
be solved) aptly expressed in the homely query,
"Which was created first, the hen or the egg?"</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the manner in which the
vital streams affecting the character of the two peoples
in regard to whom I have had the opportunity
for many years of making my observations, the
Anglo-Saxon and the German, take their course.
With the former the point of gravitation is located
in the abdomen; with the latter in the thorax.</p>

<p>This gives the Anglo-Saxon a circuitous route for
his expression in coming to the surface; his mode
of respiration being the following:</p>

<p>He inspires into the thorax posteriorly, next into
the abdomen anteriorly. He then expires from the
abdomen posteriorly, and from the thorax anteriorly;
vocal expression accompanying the last movement.</p>

<p>A German's mode of respiration is as follows: He
inspires into the abdomen posteriorly, expiring from
the abdomen anteriorly; he then inspires into the
thorax anteriorly and expires from the same posteriorly,
the latter movement only being accompanied
by sound. You will notice that in the
former case the breath to be expired and to be accompanied
by sound has been held in the thorax
until the abdomen has gone through an inspiration
and an expiration; while with Germans, inspiration
into the abdomen as well as into the thorax are succeeded
by expiration from the same, a direct proceeding
as against the indirect of the Anglo-Saxon.
Thus the former secures a force reserved and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and to be drawn upon as it is needed, while the
latter pours forth his vital force in a continuous
stream as soon as it is engendered.</p>

<p>The point of gravitation determines the mode of
breathing and the production of vocal utterance.
With Anglo-Saxons, the point of gravitation being
located in the abdomen, their speech tends from
below, upward; with Germans, the point of gravitation
being located in the thorax, their speech tends
from above, downward. The direction of Anglo-Saxon
expression is from the abdomen, where it has
its root, to the thorax; that of the German is from
the thorax, where it has its root, to the abdomen.
It will scarcely be necessary for me to say to the
reader, over and over again, "Try this," "Try
that"; I wish it to be understood, once for all,
that this recommendation is to be tacitly implied as
accompanying every statement, every proposition,
every assertion I make. Personally I can go through
any one and all of the performances at any time and
at a moment's notice. In making these experiments,
speak or sing <em>after</em> breathing in the prescribed manner.
The prescribed manner being the one in which
the <em>impression</em> is made and from which the <em>expression</em>
is produced as a matter of course and of necessity.
An Anglo-Saxon will not be able to utter a
word spoken or sung in <em>his</em> language after breathing
in the <em>German</em> fashion, nor will a German be able to
do so in <em>his</em> language after breathing in the <em>Anglo-Saxon</em>
manner. Change either manner of breathing
but in the least, and you will not be able to express
yourself in either German or English; but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
may thus be able to express yourself in some other
language. It is, of course, understood that we
breathe into the abdomen through the &#339;sophagus,
into the thorax through the trachea.</p>

<p>In trying propositions like the one now under
consideration, it may not be easy for persons who
have not previously given any thought to matters
of this kind to successfully try them. You
must give yourself up to these things, must be <em>at
home</em> for them only, for a period at least, until you
have become thoroughly engrossed with them. It
is not a study to be superficially attained. You
must enter into it with your whole soul, your entire
being. If you do, you will eventually become as
familiar with the principles underlying these matters
as you are with the letters of the alphabet, or the
figures representing the numerals, and be able to
apply the same in as easy a manner and for as
various purposes as you do these.</p>

<p>Their <em>indirect</em> mode of breathing of Anglo-Saxons
produces a deliberate mode of speech; while
German breathing, being <em>direct</em>, produces a speech
as rapid in its formation as in its utterance. <em>Action
being the counterpoise of speech, is of the inverse order
of the latter. English speech being slow and deliberate,
English action is rapid and direct; German speech being
rapid and direct, German action is slow and deliberate.</em>
English character, the same as English speech,
is distinguished by patience and forbearance; these,
when finally exhausted, are succeeded by sudden
and violent outbreaks. German character, the same
as German speech, is alternately exuberant and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>pressed;
contented, but also of a disposition to find
fault whenever the occasion may arise.</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxons, in consequence of their <em>indirect</em>
mode of expression, are in possession of a reserve
force always at their command, but only called upon
on special occasions; hence long-continued forbearance,
and then&mdash;a blow for liberty. With Germans,
in consequence of their <em>direct</em> mode of expression,
their vital force is continuously being engendered,
and as continuously being exhausted. Hence, they
are in the habit of constantly protesting, and as
constantly submitting to the <em>status quo</em>.</p>

<p>The character of Anglo-Saxons, in viewing things
from a practical standpoint, is as far removed from
the ideal as it is from the pessimistic. It is neither
exuberant, overstrained, exalted, nor despondent;
but cool, well balanced, and matter-of-fact. It is
not like the German:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Himmelhoch jauchzen, zu Tode betruebt."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">("Raised to the sky with delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depressed to the ground with despair.")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A German is influenced according to whether he can
or cannot, while losing sight of the real, satisfy his
craving for the ideal, for which, in his direct and impulsive
nature, he is constantly yearning; which the
Anglo-Saxon, seeing it is beyond his reach, abandons
as impracticable.</p>

<p>To comprehend the ideal of whatsoever nature,
the German, with endless patience, tries to solve the
most complicated problems; after solving them he
is often satisfied with the result in the abstract; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the practical Anglo-Saxon uses this result for his
utilitarian purposes. The philosophical German
patiently unravels a Gordian knot; the practical
Anglo-Saxon, "Alexander-like, cuts it in two with
his sword" ("Wie Alexander haut ihn auseinander").
Germans love education for its own sake;
it makes of them superior beings, giving them treasures
more highly prized than any others, and far
more lasting. Anglo-Saxons, on the other hand,
get their education for a purpose, and with a view
to their worldly advancement. While with Germans
education is "Selbstzweck" (its reward consisting
in its possession), with Anglo-Saxons its
reward consists in its application. The question so
often agitated in this country, whether a university
education may or may not be of benefit (that is, in
furthering his worldly advancement) to any one not
intending to embrace one of the learned professions,
would never arise in Germany; practical value and
education being things apart, the latter taking first
rank always and never being subordinated to the
former.</p>

<p>Schiller says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"[Der Edle] <em>legt</em> das Hohe in das Leben,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doch er sucht es nicht darin."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">("[Our aim should be] the noble to inculcate into life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to search for it therein.")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am inclined to think that the opposite of this is
the usual tendency with Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>Many other causes might be cited, many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
results. These, however, must answer the present
purpose, which is, to show that the course taken by
the vital streams in breathing, besides affecting their
speech, affects the <em>character</em> of nations.</p>

<p>All this might be summed up in saying: The
point of gravitation with Anglo-Saxons being located
in the abdomen, which represents the material side
of life, their being is primarily rooted in the material,
and reaches the ideal by way of the material. The
German, on the other hand, having his point of
gravitation in the thorax, which represents the
spiritual part of our existence, reaches the material
by way of the ideal, in which <em>his</em> being is primarily
rooted.</p>

<p>I owe the reader an apology for anticipating in
using the terms "streams of life" and "the point of
gravitation." These are not words without a definite
meaning, however; on the contrary, they are of the
greatest significance and of a very definite meaning.
Still, I must tax his patience for a proper explanation
thereof till I shall be able to reach them in due
course of time. We cannot approach the steep crest
of a hill by a straight line of ascent, but must patiently
wind around and around its circumference to
be able to finally reach its summit.</p>


<h3>THE AMERICAN NATION</h3>

<p>It will require but a single example, familiar to
all, to still more forcibly show that it is <em>language</em>
through whose agency national traits of character
and physical development are produced. How do
you suppose that the wonder has been wrought, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
is still daily being worked, of the great mass of
humanity reaching these shores from foreign lands
being merged into one homogeneous nation? The
remark is often made that "it is the climate." If
it were the climate, or other conditions specifically
belonging to this country, how is it that foreigners
coming here at maturity always remain foreigners,
while their offspring born and bred here become
Americans? Even children born elsewhere, but
coming here at an early age, soon become "Americanized,"
while their parents remain foreigners
always. These children must have taken a potent
draught, not partaken of by their parents, to not
only change their mode of vocal but also of physical
expression; nay, the vital expression of their
entire being. That draught is the English language.
Most foreigners respectively married to an
American wife or husband, and rearing a family of
American children, remain foreigners to the end of
their lives.</p>

<p>It often happens that parents of foreign birth
cannot comprehend the character and actions of
their own children, who are <em>so</em> different, being superficial
and frivolous, where they are deep and sound;
cool and calculating where they are fire and flame.
Yet these children possess sterling qualities of
another kind which their parents do not possess.</p>

<p>I call to mind two brothers, sons of German
parents, born in this country. With the eldest-born
the German influence was potent. He was
made to speak German at home and at school, and
is to-day, though married to an American, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
German in his manner and appearance than American,
while his mode of speaking the English language
also has something "German" in it. His
brother, on the other hand, more particularly reared
under native influences, is a thorough American.
There was nothing in this case but the influence of
language which could have caused this difference.
Similar examples might be cited endlessly.</p>

<p>If language is capable of exercising so powerful an
influence it must be more than a superficial acquirement.
It must be woven into and interwoven with
our innermost nature. What is there in the English
language to make a German's broad and massive
forehead, high cheek-bones, full lips, short chin, and
round face, in his offspring sink into narrow forms
and long, oval lines? What makes the lower jaw,
which in him was short and round, in these children
sink down and extend outward, while the upper jaw
recedes back? What is it that makes the jovial and
happy expression of the German in his children
change into features of an impassive nature, from
which they are only roused when in action?&mdash;features
of which it has been said that it is sometimes difficult
to know whether they, sphinx-like, cover a happy
or unhappy disposition; a disposition sometimes so
self-possessed and reserved that its owner might
almost reply as Alva did, when asked why he never
smiled: "I would not so demean myself before myself
as to smile." Yet when such a face (especially
when it is a girl's) <em>does</em> smile, its passive features
are lighted up in a manner so enchanting that its
beauty amply compensates for its previous apathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not wish to say, however, that Anglo-Saxons
do not <em>feel</em> either joy or sorrow as keenly as Germans
do (though I have my doubts even on this
score); but they do not carry their feelings with
them on the surface. They sink them into that
reserve, at once proud and self-possessed, which does
not wish others to take cognizance of their private
affairs. The nature of the Anglo-Saxon is one
of <em>reserve</em>, that of the German one of <em>abandon</em> and
<em>laisser-aller</em>. This is not due to heredity in the first
instance, but to the influence of language, by which
character and habits are formed.</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes relates that, after a protracted search
for his son, who had been wounded in the battle of
Gettysburg, when at last finding the "Captain"
in a transport train, he went up to him, simply saying,
"How are you, Bob?" and he replying, "How
are you, Dad?"&mdash;stating at the same time, "Such
is the force of our national habit that, especially
in the presence of strangers, we suppress the impulse
of our most ardent feelings," or words to that
effect. A similar proceeding under such circumstances
would be considered "unnatural" among
Germans.</p>

<p>Regarding the change of features, as between
foreign-born (German) parents and their English-speaking
offspring, by which the latter's assume a
shape which makes the &#339;sophagus predominate
over the trachea, it will be as impossible for these
children to speak <em>idiomatically correct</em> German as it
is for their parents, with whom the trachea predominates
over the &#339;sophagus, to speak idiomatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
correct English. When my features assume the
proper shape for English speech, I cannot produce
a single correct German sound, and when they assume
the proper shape for German speech, it is as impossible
for me to produce a correct English sound.</p>

<p>I expect that this statement will be hotly disputed.
The measure of our ordinary mode of listening,
however, must not be applied to these
matters. In some rare instances the difference is
so slight that it takes a very acute ear to notice it.</p>


<h3>CENTRIPETAL AND CENTRIFUGAL</h3>

<p>While speaking our native tongue our muscles
move, our sinews tend, our vessels lean, <em>our</em> blood
throbs, and our nerves tingle with the essence of our
language in <em>its</em> direction, and not in the direction
of any other language. We not only speak and
sing our language, but we gesticulate it, we walk it,
dance it, write it, think it, smile it, and sorrow in
it. Everything we do is done differently from the
same thing done by a person speaking another language.
The movements of the muscles of a German
are centripetal, while those of an Anglo-Saxon are
centrifugal. With a German they close in around
the mouth; with an Anglo-Saxon they depart from
the mouth upward and downward. Hence the
broad features of the German <em>versus</em> the elongated
ones of the Anglo-Saxon. Look at the old people.
The centrifugal action with an Anglo-Saxon even in
old age still leaves his form erect, his face serene,
scarcely showing a wrinkle, either on his forehead,
his cheeks, or around the eyes and mouth. Apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
from his bleached hair, he frequently retains a quite
youthful appearance. The centripetal action with
a German in old age, on the other hand, has a tendency
to bend his form and draw it together, and to
shrivel up his skin into innumerable wrinkles, so that
his mouth often resembles the mouth of a purse
drawn close together. This youthful appearance
with aged English-speaking people reflects on their
customs and their costume, which latter retains
much of the tidiness of their younger days. Germans,
on the other hand, age soon. This fact is so
apparent that they conform their habits and general
appearance to their age. They feel old, and unhesitatingly
submit to their aged condition. They
often appear old when still comparatively young.
English-speaking old people, on the other hand, are
never too old not to wish to appear young. For
the terms "Greis" and "Greisin," which imply a
weakened and somewhat helpless condition, there is
no corresponding expression in the English language.</p>

<p>Observe a gang of laborers carrying a heavy log.
If there are Germans among them, their heads and
shoulders will be bent, as well as their knees, resembling
caryatides in Gothic churches. <em>They carry
from below, upward.</em> Those who speak English, on
the other hand, will walk with heads erect, straight
shoulders, and stiff knees, resembling the caryatides
of the Greek temples. <em>They carry from above,
downward.</em></p>

<p>The German mode of expression is produced by
contraction, expansion, contraction; the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
by expansion, contraction, expansion. For the
former, contraction takes place <em>towards</em> the diaphragm,
first upward and then downward; that is,
from the feet upward, and then from the head
downward. For the latter, expansion takes place
<em>from</em> the diaphragm, first upward and then downward;
that is, from the diaphragm towards the head,
and then from the diaphragm towards the feet.</p>

<p>Artists must study these things if they want to
get a proper insight into life, and the action of
life, characteristic of different nations. The simple
study of anatomy gives them no clue to these
matters. Everything we do is done differently
from the same thing being done by a person speaking
another language. The books on physiology
do not make mention of these matters. They
treat all nations alike. They tell an Englishman
that in closing his mouth the muscles of the upper
lip by a direct action are first raised and then
lowered, while those of the lower are first lowered
and then raised. As a matter of fact, the natural
tendency with English-speaking people is towards
having their mouths open. In closing the same the
lower lip is first raised, then lowered, the upper is
first lowered, then raised, and again lowered; whereupon
the lower lip is raised. This gives three
movements to each lip. The natural tendency with
Germans is towards keeping their mouths closed.
To <em>firmly</em> close the same they must raise the upper
lip, lower the lower, lower the upper, and then raise
the lower. This gives two movements to each lip.
These motions are <em>indirect</em> with Anglo-Saxons, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Germans they are <em>direct</em>. With Anglo-Saxons the
lower jaw is the main instrument; with Germans it
is the upper. With Anglo-Saxons the lower moves
up to the upper; while with Germans the upper
closes down on the lower. That Anglo-Saxons
move their lower jaw up to the upper, to them will
appear as a matter of course; yet Germans do not do
this; with them the lower jaw is first raised to be in
position to be met by the upper, the latter being
lowered from the atlas by motions made by the entire
upper part of the head.</p>

<p>During speech the head of an Anglo-Saxon remains
impassive; there is no perceptible movement
except in connection with his lower jaw. Hence
his stolid immovability in contradistinction with the
mobility and vivacity of a German, whose entire
head, often accompanied by his entire body, appears
to take part in his speech. These motions,
though fundamental with these peoples, vary with
locality, individual character, temperament, etc. A
German if he keeps his cranium entirely still will
be unable to produce a sound; while an Anglo-Saxon
will be unable to produce a sound if he should
move it as Germans do. A German's power of
vocal utterance lies in the flexibility of his cranium;
an Anglo-Saxon's in that of his lower jaw.</p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon grinds the teeth of his lower
jaw, in anger or in passion, or while masticating
food, or under any other circumstances, against those
of his upper; a German grinds those of his upper
jaw against those of the lower.</p>

<p>All motions in connection with vocal utterance on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the part of an Anglo-Saxon are of a decidedly larger
compass than those of a German; the latter being
confined to the slight motions he is able to make
with his head, while the former frequently draws
down his lower jaw to a very great extent, far more
so than a German would be able to draw down his.</p>

<p>The "life" with the German is in the upper, with
Anglo-Saxons it is in the lower jaw; the former
representing the thorax, the latter the abdomen.
While the thorax, as already mentioned, with Germans
is the predominating vehicle for every performance
of life, with Anglo-Saxons it is the abdomen.</p>

<p>With Germans the lower jaw is the anvil, the
upper the hammer; with Anglo-Saxons the upper is
the anvil, the lower the hammer; the action, the
life, always being with the hammer.</p>

<p>If you watch an American girl chewing taffy you
will find her lower jaw going way down, then out,
and up again. This is characteristic of the manner
in which Anglo-Saxons breathe and speak. The
chewing process, owing to the adhesion of the taffy
to the teeth, together with the greater flexibility of
a girl's jaws, brings out these features more strikingly
than under ordinary circumstances. In chewing
taffy the lower jaw (the hammer) meets with
some difficulty in making its movements; it is
therefore lowered as much as possible, so as to be
able to more effectually close in with the upper (the
anvil). A German girl's movements under similar
conditions are restricted, being largely confined to
the upper jaw, which cannot be raised to any great
extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon speaker or singer makes movements
similar to such a chewer of taffy. He draws
his lower jaw down and out to make room in the
lower cavity of his mouth for the expression of his
main sounds. These are the product of the abdominal
cavity and find their way out through the
&#339;sophagus from <em>beneath</em> the lower surface of the
tongue. Here they pass the replica and the fr&aelig;num,
which impart to them their rhythmical expression.
Any one doubting the correctness of these
statements, by making the replica and the fr&aelig;num,
or either of them, rigid, will not, if he is an Anglo-Saxon,
be able to produce a single sound; if he is a
German, he will still be able to utter his main sounds
coming to the surface through the trachea, over and
above his tongue. An Anglo-Saxon, on the other
hand, may still speak when he makes the vocal cords
of the larynx rigid; while a German in that case
will be unable to produce any sound whatsoever.
To these matters I have already called attention in
a previous publication, in connection with the man
who was deprived of his larynx by a surgical operation,
but not of his power of speech.</p>

<p>A similar experiment may be made in regard to
breathing. By making the soft palate, representing
the thorax, rigid, you will not be able to inspire,
though you may expire. By making the bottom
of the mouth close to your teeth (<em>the soft palate of
the lower jaw</em>), representing the abdomen, rigid, you
will not be able to expire, though you may inspire.
With a German the precisely opposite facts prevail.
By making the soft palate rigid, he will stop expira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>tion;
by making the bottom of the mouth close to
the teeth rigid, he will stop inspiration.</p>

<p>During vocal utterance, with Germans every superior
muscle first moves downward, every inferior
upward; while with Anglo-Saxons every superior
muscle first moves upward, every inferior downward.
This is preparatory and previous to action. <em>During</em>
action the German opens his mouth, the Anglo-Saxon
closes his. Hence the Anglo-Saxon's half-open
mouth while in repose, and his almost stern
expression while in action, pleasurable action even,
which has provoked the witty saying that "Englishmen
take to their pleasures sadly."</p>

<p>The abdomen being the centre of gravity for English
speech, and the lower jaw being in direct communication
with the same by way of the &#339;sophagus,
by making the lower jaw rigid you stop the flow of
English sounds. The thorax, on the other hand,
being the centre of gravity for German speech, and
the upper jaw being in direct communication with
the same by way of the trachea, in making this jaw
rigid you stop the flow of German sounds.</p>


<h3>ROTATION OF CENTRIPETAL AND CENTRIFUGAL
ACTION</h3>

<p>Speaking of centripetal and centrifugal motion as
separate actions, there must, of course, be a <em>rotation</em>
of these actions to produce a <em>complete</em> action of any
kind. We, however, speak of the one which <em>prevails</em>
over the other, as <em>the</em> action under consideration.
Thus when I say a German's mode of eating
is centripetal, I say so because the action of his jaws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
being direct, it is first centrifugal, then centripetal,
then centrifugal, then again centripetal. When I
say an Anglo-Saxon's mode is centrifugal, I say so
because the action of his jaws being indirect, it is
first centripetal, then centrifugal, then centripetal,
then again centrifugal, and finally once more centripetal.
This, with a German, of course, means:
Open, close, open, close. With an Anglo-Saxon it
means: Close, open, close, open, close. This, however,
only gives the main features of an act of eating,
etc., as well as uttering sounds; any of these acts,
in reality, requiring <em>eight</em> movements to carry on
one <em>complete</em> act. When centrifugal prevails centripetal
follows, and when centripetal prevails centrifugal
follows. It stands to reason that an action
which is composed of open, close, open, close, or
close, open, close, open, close, cannot continue in
the same rotation indefinitely, but must be complemented
by a motion of the opposite nature; such
complementary action, however, always being executed
inwardly and not outwardly. While the
action of the jaws just now described precedes
mastication, the inner action complementary thereof
is accompanied by the act of swallowing.</p>

<p>Thus with a German there are four movements
preceding mastication and four for swallowing; with
an Anglo-Saxon there are five movements for the
former and three for the latter; while the act of
mastication proper with both nations consists of
eight movements which are repeated as often as is
necessary for the act of swallowing.</p>

<p>The respective manner in which knives and forks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
are handled in eating by Germans and Anglo-Saxons,
as well as the different manner in which they dance,
and the characters they use in writing, might be
cited as results of the different modes in which centripetal
and centrifugal actions prevail with them.
The characters Germans use in writing being centrifugal
in their nature and those Anglo-Saxons use
centripetal, this can only be accounted for by assuming
that the muscular action preparatory to the act
of writing in both instances is of the opposite nature.</p>

<p>In consequence of the centrifugal movements of
their jaws and lips, the teeth, with English-speaking
persons, are always on exhibition; while the centripetal
movement prevailing with Germans conceals
them. The consequence is that English-speaking
people pay the utmost attention to the care and
perfection of their teeth, while Germans, in the
highest ranks even, frequently neglect them to an
almost shameful degree. The direct outcome of
this state of affairs is the great advancement which
the practice of dentistry has made in this country
and in England, while it is one to which, on the continent
of Europe, but comparatively little attention
is being paid.</p>

<p>With English-speaking people, especially the
women, whose lips are more flexible than men's,
the teeth of the upper jaw are more frequently exposed
than those of the lower, for this reason: The
&#339;sophagus being the main instrument for English
speech, its sounds, in coming to the surface from
beneath the tongue, require the latter to remain in
a semi-raised position most of the time; the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
lip, being in the way of these sounds coming to the
surface, must be raised for the same reason; in so
doing it exposes the upper row of teeth. The lower
lip is lowered for the sounds of the trachea for the
same reason that the upper is raised for those of the
&#339;sophagus. Whenever the upper lip is raised
the lower must be immediately lowered, and vice
versa. With Anglo-Saxons the main movement is
with the upper, with Germans it is with the lower
lip. Owing to the centripetal action with Germans,
these movements are less pronounced than they are
with English-speaking people.</p>

<p>The act of smiling being produced in the same
order as that of speaking, the same conditions prevail
in relation to the same.</p>

<p>In speaking English you can "feel" that the
upper lip is the main vehicle; <em>it has all the life in it</em>.
In speaking German you can "feel" it is the lower,
which for that language possesses the life. If you
make the former rigid you cannot speak English; if
you make the latter rigid you cannot speak German.</p>

<p>In connection with the movements of the lips it
will be noticed that while the upper jaw and the roof
of the mouth are dominated by the trachea and
the thorax, and the lower jaw and the bottom of the
mouth by the &#339;sophagus and the abdomen, the
upper lip is dominated by the sounds of the &#339;sophagus,
and the lower by those of the trachea.
This, however, is owing to mechanical reasons only,
as explained, and not to vital causes.</p>

<p>The foreigner who learns to speak the English
language ever so well, though he may reside here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
almost a lifetime, if he does not learn to speak it
<em>idiomatically</em> correct, will not be influenced by it to
any great extent in any of the various manners of
which I have made mention, either as regards his
features, character, habits, motions, thoughts, etc.;
but, in spite of his "English," he will still be a
foreigner. This foreigner's children, however, provided
he does not influence them to the contrary
through pride of his native tongue, and if reared
under native influences, will become thorough
Americans.</p>

<p>There need be no fear, therefore, that immigration
might bring to this country a permanent foreign
element. Such elements, when they do come,
are of a passing nature. Their offspring, in passing
the crucial test of the English tongue, sink the foreigner
into the all-absorbing element of the English
idiom; and in so doing are merged into and become
an integral part of the people of this country. They
may come of whatever nation, from whatever land;
no matter how they may appear, act, or speak, the
English idiom will continue to make them Americans,
in their children at least, in the future as it
has in the past. There is thus in the centrifugal
force which dominates the speech of Anglo-Saxons
that which is a safeguard to the homogeneity as well
as the institutions of this nation.</p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon cannot be a bondsman; his language
forbids it. The centrifugal force which prevails
with him does not permit fetters. The children
of all foreigners born here and speaking the English
language come under its spell. If language did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
have this supreme influence, there is no other influence
that would have prevented this country long
ago from having become inhabited in special districts
with permanent groups of people foreign to its aims
and institutions, and alien to its genius, its character,
and its customs. In districts where German is
spoken as the principal language, as in some parts
of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, it is not, with the
native-born at least, the pure German language, but
its idiomatic expression is that of the English tongue.</p>

<p>People say, "It is the climate." We have every
climate under the sun; yet in all that is essential
the man from Maine is as thoroughly American as
the one from Texas; the gold-digger in the frozen
regions of the Yukon as the man of the orange-groves
of Florida or California; the American fisherman
on the Banks of Newfoundland as those on the
Gulf of Mexico; the man who battles on the plains
against the Indians as he who serves under the banner
of the Republic and upholds its glory in foreign
lands and seas. You can tell an American the moment
you look at him. Yet if you ask some of them
where their parents were born, you will hear strange
tales of lands and peoples across the sea and far
away.</p>

<p>Language does not work <em>every</em> wonder, of course.
The influence of heredity perpetuates that of language;
but the latter is the primary influence. Nor
can it be denied that <em>every</em> foreigner living here for
some time, whether he has learned to speak English
or not, will, to some extent at least, be influenced
by the habits, customs, institutions, climate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
language of this country. This does not detract,
however, from the force of my argument regarding
language and its influence as the most vital force in
shaping a people's characteristic traits, physically as
well as spiritually.</p>

<p>There has been of late a great deal of talk and enthusiasm
even regarding the desirability of a closer
alliance between the two great English-speaking nations;
their natural affinity and kinship. This affinity,
this belonging together, this being of one family
and one stock, is commonly expressed by this term,
"English-speaking peoples." That which I have
endeavored to explain at length is thus tacitly acknowledged
to be correct through the use of this
term, which implies that it is <em>the English tongue</em>
which makes these peoples one in sentiment, in feeling,
in their aims and purposes, as it makes them
one in their physical appearance, their motions, the
exercise of their faculties and functions, etc.</p>

<h2>NATIONALITY AND RACE DISTINCTIONS</h2>


<p>While the English language makes Americans
of all foreigners, it does not, of course, obliterate
race distinctions as long as races continue to
exist as such. Persons of alien races, nevertheless,
when born in this country and reared under native
influences, will become "American" in a truer sense
than foreigners belonging to the Caucasian race coming
here at maturity. I dare say Frederick Douglass
was truly more of an American, in all this word implies,
than any foreigner who ever came to live here;
and so are all the better classes of native-born negroes,
in a certain sense, more truly American, this indescribable
something which constitutes a nation, than
any aliens whosoever.</p>

<p>A gentleman once told me that, travelling on a
steamboat on one of the New England rivers, he had
been inadvertently listening to a conversation carried
on behind him, between what seemed to be
two New England farmers. On rising from his
seat, he saw that one of the men was a Chinaman,
dressed like the other and conversing precisely as
he did.</p>

<p>Seeing an acquaintance, he pointed out the Chinaman
and asked if he knew who he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Jimmy O'Connor; he's from So-and-so."</p>

<p>"I mean the Chinaman."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Chinaman; that's him. You know
he was picked up at sea, when still a baby, by a
New Bedford whaler, and was brought up in the
captain's family, who adopted him. He's as good
a farmer and as true an American as you can find
anywhere."</p>

<p>These studies are meant to be purely objective,
and have no concern with politics or policies, regarding
undesirable immigration, or issues of a similar
nature. But language is nationality, and nationality
language, always, in the first instance; and the purer
a language is spoken, the truer, purer, and better
such nationality will be expressed and represented
by those who thus speak it. What an incentive to
aim at the purest and best expression of language,
for any people! But it will be said that language
is subject to change. If it is, so will the people who
speak it to some extent change with it. Such change,
however, is in its dress, in words mainly; rarely and
at long intervals, and under very peculiar circumstances
only, in its expression. As a matter of fact,
I doubt whether a change of the <em>idiomatic expression
ever</em> takes place.</p>

<p>The difference existing between the English
spoken in the United States and the mother country
might be cited as an example. The idiomatic expression
is precisely the same. But the necessary
self-reliance of the first settlers, the privation, the
barter and exchange, the vast extent of the territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of this country, the greater independence enjoyed
by its people, etc., might be named as reasons for
the greater dash and freedom, together with a possible
want of culture, as compared with the language
spoken by educated Englishmen, prevailing in its
utterance.</p>

<p>The same influences prevail regarding the general
appearance, motions, and characteristic traits of
these respective nations. Though closely allied and
connected in a specific, and very nearly allied to
each other in a general sense, there is that which
distinguishes the English of the old world from
those of the new, and which can be easily recognized.</p>

<p>Being centrifugal, the English idiom, octopus-like,
embraces anything and everything that comes
within the radius of its omnivorous capacity, without,
however, losing its original character. It is
like a fisherman who has hung out his net in the
ocean, taking in all that comes along; or like the
sea itself, greedy without end. It has no scruples
about roots and construction, but construes everything
according to its wants and adapts it to its uses
as it comes along from any quarter.</p>

<p>These adopted children, these waifs, however, it
must not be lost sight of, before they become integral
parts of English speech must submit to a
change of their original idiomatic expression. No
matter who came&mdash;Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons,
or French&mdash;the people of the British Islands, while
adopting their <em>terms</em> of expression, remained true to
their original <em>idiomatic</em> expression. As this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
absorbs people from the whole world and makes one
homogeneous American nation of them, so has the
English language absorbed, and is still absorbing,
words from every other people's language, and has
transformed them into one homogeneous language
of its own.</p>

<p>Comparative philology, if it wants to accomplish
that which would be most worthy of its efforts, will
have to come down to these strong and basic roots
of language.</p>

<p>The German language, whose idiomatic expression
is centripetal, on the other hand, does not possess
the same capacity for adopting foreign words and
adapting them to its idiom. When it does adopt
them, as, for instance, those of French origin, they
are pronounced, not in the German, but, as far as
the German people are capable of so doing, in the
French manner. They could not, in fact, be pronounced
in the German manner, the German language
being a close corporation, so to say, which does
not admit of any foreign shareholders; while the
English language is a company open to all comers.
While it is the endeavor of Germans to <em>purify</em> their
language by expelling as far as possible any foreign
word and element therefrom, Anglo-Saxons are constantly
adopting new words from foreign languages.
It would be equal to the labor of Sisyphus for Anglo-Saxons
to endeavor to purify their language from
foreign words, in the same sense that Germans are
attempting to purify theirs.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the capacity of England for
successful colonization is largely due to the centrif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ugal
force inherent in its language, while the want
of success of Germany for the same purpose is due
to the absence of this force. Anglo-Saxon government
tends toward decentralization, German toward
centralization. I say this in spite of the fact that
Germany is still divided into many principalities;
the fact of its adherence to this undesirable condition
being a proof of the correctness of this assertion
rather than otherwise&mdash;Germans not being able to
readily get out of that in which they are once rooted.
In regard to governing peoples in distant territories
or colonies, this tendency is of importance. English
government, being undemonstrative, is more
effective than German, which is demonstrative,
meddlesome, and therefore offensive; the former
being material and practical, the latter immaterial
and inclined to be visionary.</p>

<p>In a word, where are we to find explanations regarding
national traits of character except through
inner motive powers, productive of results individual
as well as national? There is no factor which
exercises an influence upon a nation as a unit so
wide in extent and of so powerful a nature as that
of language. It is the <em>only</em> motive power, in fact,
which every member of a nation shares with every
other member thereof, but not with any member of
any foreign nation.</p>


<h3>IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION</h3>

<p>Although it is a well known fact that every language
has an idiomatic expression, an intonation of
its own, I am not aware of any attempt ever having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
been made at definitely stating what such expression,
or intonation, really consists in; and in what
respect it differs, as between one language and another.
Yet this fact should be the most important
of all in connection with ethnological studies. It
is necessary to know what a people's idiomatic expression
is before we can begin to make a study of
its language, in comparison with that of any other
people, by which we may expect to arrive at conclusions
of any real value in an ethnological sense.</p>

<p>In comparison with idiomatic expression, the
study of the roots of words and their derivation, it
appears to me, is of but secondary importance;
idiomatic expression being the <em>kernel</em> in which the
tree of national expression had its incipiency, its
origin. It is the life which pulsates through its
veins, in which it has its stay and maintenance; the
nerves which tingle with its intelligence, its genius,
its soul. Take away this soul, and it ceases to exist.
For every language there must have been a strong
impulse making an impression before there could
have been any expression at all. This impulse must
have been of so powerful and continuous a nature
as to have left its impression upon the minds of a
sufficiently large number of people to form the nucleus
for the expression of a specific language, and,
in so doing, constituting such people a nation.</p>

<p>I have already stated that it is <em>motion</em> in the first
instance which superinduces a specific mode of
breathing and consequent expression. It is to
motion, then, that we must ascribe the first impulse.
Such motion may have been active as to defense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
against enemies, wild beasts, or the elements; or it
may have been passive, consisting of the continuous
noise produced by the motion of the sea, tempests,
or thunder-storms, making a great and lasting
impression. Then, again, the influence may have
been of a peaceful, balmy, beneficial nature, as with
people living in security, in a mild climate and on
fertile lands. The stronger the expression of these
movements, the stronger the impression they made
and the more powerful the expression of the language;
the softer and more harmonious their expression,
the softer and the more rhythmical the
expression of the language. These influences made
their first impression by superinducing a mode of
breathing in conformity therewith.</p>

<p>Thus sounds giving expression to pain, perhaps,
in the first instance, or to sorrow, joy, surprise,
etc., were made in conformity with this, their specific
mode of breathing. These outcries, consisting of
syllables, grew into words and sentences, which,
being uttered in conformity and sympathy with their
special mode of breathing, created a specific idiomatic
expression. The same process, from its first
inauguration, and with but slight alterations, has
been practised and persisted in by the same people
from the beginning to the present time. With the
English people, as already mentioned, no migration,
no invasion, no conqueror, no matter how powerful,
has been able to swerve it from its path. The <em>most</em>
these invaders could do was to graft some of the expressions
in which <em>their</em> ideas were clad, some words,
on to this aboriginal stem. This stem was so strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
in its primeval conception that it could bear all these
exotic graftings without losing its character, absorbing
all, welcoming all beneath the widespread roof
and homestead of its branches. It proved its
superiority over the idiomatic expression of these
foreign tongues by its survival, as the fittest.</p>

<p>[Before proceeding further, I want to remark:
these studies having been made from an Anglo-Saxon
point of view, it is just possible that a preponderance
of observations may have been made on
that side; while, if they had been made from a German
standpoint, the preponderance most likely
would be on that side. This, no doubt, will be the
case should I at any future period be able to write
all this, as I intend to, in the German language.]</p>

<p>What is this original sap in the English, and
what is it in the German language?</p>

<p>The aborigines of the British Isles, living apart
from their continental brethren, became possessed of
an idiom different and apart from any other. It was
the idiom of the <em>sea</em>, by which they were surrounded;
the motion and commotion of the waves, the surf,
the incoming and outgoing tides, their undertow
and overflow; the waves advancing toward the
shore, their breaking against it, and their final retreat
from the same.</p>

<p>The English language is a raft living upon the
ocean. You can <em>hear</em> the waters rushing through it
and on to the shore and back again. You can feel
the waves rising up to gigantic heights, and then
falling to and below the level of the sea. You can
feel the undertow in its reserve force, quiet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
subdued like the lull before the storm, yet capable
of almost any demonstration. You can feel all this
in the strength and vigor of its diction as expressed
in its prose and poetry. This is not a mere poetical
conception, but a truth capable of actual, practical
demonstration.</p>

<p>While reading poetry or prose, or while singing,
fancy seeing in your mind's eye the ocean with its
waters in commotion, either the open sea or the surf
near the shore, and you will <em>feel every word you
utter mingle with its waves. These pictures will
never disturb your fancy, but will associate with it
in perfect harmony.</em> Now substitute for the picture
of the ocean and its tumult some rural picture, as
of a field of grain or the branches of trees tossed by
the wind, or the flow of a river, or even that of the
sea itself when perfectly calm. Keep such picture
before you exactly as you did that of the sea in
commotion. While reading, speaking, or singing
English you will not be able to <em>hold</em> such picture;
<em>it will soon disturb you, and to such an extent that
you must cease thinking of it, or be obliged to stop your
reading, singing, etc.</em></p>

<p>The impression made by the ocean, in fact, is so
great that it dominates the <em>thought</em> and the entire
being of English-speaking people. This is the case
to such an extent that if you continue to persistently
<em>think</em> of any other image than the ocean, even without
uttering any sound whatever, it will so greatly
perturb you that you will be unable to continue
thinking at all. You may, on the other hand, continue
to think for an indefinite period of the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of the ocean without experiencing any disturbance
whatever.</p>

<p>While the basic element of the English language
is closely affiliated with the ocean, that of the <em>German
language</em> is affiliated with the <em>woods, and the
blowing of the winds</em>. In their habitation in the
forest, the wind made so deep an impression on the
primeval inhabitants of Germany that you can feel
its <em>soughing pervade all German diction</em>.</p>

<p>If you are a German keep the picture of the
woods before you and the soughing of the wind
through the tree-tops, and it will harmonize with
German thought and diction. Substitute a picture
of the ocean for it, or almost any other picture, and
you will not be able to vocally utter German thought,
nor will you be able to continue thinking in the
German language at all.</p>

<p>In place of conjuring up these pictures in your
mind's eye you can substitute <em>real</em> pictures representing
these scenes, and while contemplating them
the effect will be the same.</p>

<p>After pursuing the picture of the ocean for a
while, say: "English;" after pursuing that of the
woods, say: "Deutsch;" either will come quite
naturally, but you cannot reverse them. If you
attempt it, these words will not be forthcoming.</p>

<p>While with English diction there is <em>a pause and
then an emphasis</em> as of the waves coming on and then
breaking against the shore, so, with German diction,
there is an <em>emphasis and then a pause</em>, as of the blowing
of the wind succeeded by a calm. These, in a
word, are the characteristic elements in the idiomatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
expressions of these peoples; English idiomatic expression
being <em>low succeeded by loud</em>; German, <em>loud
succeeded by low</em>.</p>

<p>The influence of the ocean with its continuous
uproar formulated the speech and character of the
English nation into one of strength and reality, with
its centre of gravity in the abdomen. The peaceful
influence of their habitation in the woods, together
with the impression made by the wind, the singing
of birds, etc., formulated the speech and character
of the German nation into one more of ideality, with
its centre of gravity in the thorax.</p>

<p>The fondness of the English for the sea, their supremacy
thereon, etc., need not be amplified upon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wherever billows foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Briton fights at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hearth is built of water."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fondness of the Germans for the woods is
equally noted: Der "dunkle," "zauberische," "geheimnissvolle,"
"heilige"&mdash;Wald (The "darkly
deep," "magical," "mysterious," and "sacred"
woods) are but common expressions.</p>

<p>There is not a word in the English language of the
same significance as that of "Der Wald." It embraces
many ideas, of which the words "the woods"
and "the forest" are not expressive. These, in a
literal translation, find expression in the words
"Das Gehoelz" and "Der Forst," which are of a
more realistic nature.</p>

<p>The English language, on the other hand, is full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of expressions applying to nautical matters and to
the sea, for which there are no adequate expressions
in the German language.</p>

<p>The fondness of the present Emperor of Germany
for the sea must be attributed to the English blood
flowing in his veins. While it is his desire to create
a powerful navy, the people of Germany are indifferent
to, and obstruct rather than assist, the accomplishment
of this desire.</p>

<p>Idiomatic expression, the soul of language, has its
incipiency in the <em>soul</em> of a people, and may pervade
it for centuries before the <em>body</em> of the language, the
<em>words</em> in which its thoughts are clad, makes its
appearance. It must have taken many centuries
more before these words grouped themselves into
sentences and assumed the shape of speech. The
words may change, but the idiomatic expression
will always remain the same.</p>

<p>So, also, must the soul of man have had existence
for an indefinite period of time before a body was
formulated to clothe it in. The spiritual cell, if I
may be permitted to use such an expression, must
have existed before the material; or, in other words,
the spiritual cell must have made its appearance
long before the material cell <em>commenced</em> to make its
appearance.</p>


<h3>RELATIONSHIP SUPPOSED TO EXIST AS BETWEEN
THE GERMAN AND ENGLISH NATIONS</h3>

<p>It is a common saying that there is a close relationship
existing between the German and English
nations. There is no greater fallacy than this. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
contend that this relationship is of a very distant
order, consisting, as it does, merely in words, or, as
I have said, garments loosely flung around the
sturdy, strong, and unalterable stem of English
idiomatic expression. In every other respect there
is a great dissimilarity and antagonism even, existing
between these two peoples. If there is any
analogy existing between them at all, it is one of
opposition; one that is based on the idea that extremes
meet (<em>les extr&ecirc;mes se touchent</em>), their poles
being diametrically opposed to each other.</p>

<p>There is no more relationship existing between
(Anglo-Saxon) German and English than there is
between (Norman) French and English; the German,
French, and English languages each possessing
their own especial and unalterable idiomatic
expressions. Whatever foreign words either of
them adopt must be subjected to their idiom, or
keep floating along as best they may in their original
character.</p>

<p>The entire aspect of these three nations, the
French, English, and German, points to the fact that
there must be a radical difference in their vital mode
of existence. Just what this vital mode consists
in, in respect to the two latter nations, I expect to
still further establish in a future publication. Both
languages traverse nearly the entire range of the
vital organs in opposite directions. Hence the
strength and also the weaknesses of these languages,
as compared with other languages which, extending
from side to side, have a smaller compass but a comparatively
purer range of sounds. Regarding other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
nations and their languages, I trust others, thoroughly
familiar with the same, by applying to their investigations
similar principles, will establish similar facts.</p>

<p>Owing to its centrifugal tendency, it is necessary
for English vocal utterance to open the mouth much
wider than it is for German. Let a German open
his mouth no farther for the enunciation of English
than he is in the habit of opening it while speaking
his own language, and he will not be able to utter a
single sound. The same result will obtain when an
Anglo-Saxon attempts to speak German on the same
basis that he is in the habit of speaking his own
language. Owing to the centripetal tendency of
the German language, the mouth in speaking German
is but slightly extended. That this respective
widening and narrowing of, not only the mouth but
of every other channel employed in bringing about
vocal utterance, must tend to exercise a marked influence
on Anglo-Saxon and German features will
be obvious. The consequence is that the mouth of
English-speaking persons in thus being extended has
a broad yet narrow appearance, with rather thin and
compressed lips, while the mouth of Germans in
thus being contracted is comparatively smaller, with
full and ripe lips. This feature is in conformity
with all other features which, with Anglo-Saxons,
are elongated, with Germans contracted.</p>

<p>Experiments regarding centrifugal and centripetal
action can be made to good advantage by resting
your head sideways on a pillow. In this position
during vocal utterance you can <em>feel</em> these actions,
and, feeling them, "<em>measure</em>" them. This mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
proceeding can be successfully adopted in many
other experiments connected with these studies. I
must warn the reader, however, again and again,
that all this has reference only to languages spoken
idiomatically correct. It has no reference whatever
to foreign languages spoken in the usual mechanical
manner.</p>


<h3>LANGUAGE AND MOTION</h3>

<p>I will now show that motion is the first impulse
and primary condition of speech. I will give but a
few examples at present, but expect to prove most
exhaustively later on that motion <em>must</em> precede, or
<em>apparently at least</em>, accompany vocal sounds <em>always</em>.</p>

<p>While standing up, straight, throw out your arms
horizontally, then speak English. You will have
no difficulty, but you will not be able to speak German
so easily. Next, stand as before, and again
throw out your arms horizontally, then drop them,
letting them hang down close to your body. After
doing so you will have no difficulty in speaking
German, but you will not be able to speak English
so readily. In throwing out your arms in the first
instance, your mouth will open, and you will <em>close</em> it
in speaking English. In letting them drop, in the
second instance, your mouth will close, and you
will <em>open</em> it in speaking German. Now, stand on
the tips of your toes, and you will have no difficulty
in speaking English, but you will not be able to speak
German with ease. Then rest the weight of your
body on your heels, and you will have no trouble
in speaking German, but you cannot speak English
with ease. In standing on the toes the body is ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>tended
by centrifugal, in standing on the heels it is
contracted by centripetal action. Next, extend
your neck, and you will have less trouble in speaking
English than in speaking German; then lower
your neck, and you will find no trouble in speaking
German, but you will in speaking English. These
experiments might be amplified manifold, but these
must suffice for the present.</p>

<p>The same features of the opening and closing of
the mouth in conformity with the position you assume,
will obtain in all these instances the same
as at first mentioned. It will scarcely be necessary
for me to repeat that all this shows that the motion
for English speech is centrifugal, for German centripetal.
Nor will it be necessary to call attention to
the fact that all this tends towards giving Germans
a condensed and broad, Anglo-Saxons a lengthy
and narrow bodily appearance.</p>

<p>It is, however, a noteworthy fact that with Germans
the nearer you approach the sea, the more
centrifugal becomes their action and personal appearance.
The people of Northern Germany, therefore,
though radically differing from them in most
other respects, partake more of the general bodily features
of Anglo-Saxon nations than those of the South
of Germany, who are positively opposed to them.</p>

<p>Upon having ascertained the correctness of these
statements by actual experiment, I want to ask the
reader how he expects to reconcile these facts with
the universally adopted theory that the larynx is the
sole instrument productive of vocal utterance. An
Anglo-Saxon, when stretching out his arms horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>tally,
can readily speak English, while a German in
the same position cannot utter a sound of <em>his</em> language
without difficulty. If the larynx in the case
of an Anglo-Saxon, under these circumstances,
produces vocal utterance, why is it not so easy with
a German?</p>

<p>My explanation is this:</p>

<p>By extending your limbs, in stretching out your
arms, or standing on your toes, the centrifugal action
is instrumental in parting the jaws and giving
the tongue an upward tendency. In so doing,
the &#339;sophagus and replica obtain ascendancy over
the trachea and the larynx. The abdomen (the seat
of gravitation for English speech) and its tributaries
thus obtain the mastery over the thorax and its
tributaries. The former being the main vehicle for
English speech, such speech can be produced without
molestation. These facts, while favorable to
the production of English vocal utterance, obstruct
and hinder German vocal utterance.</p>

<p>In lowering the arms or standing on one's heels,
thus substituting centripetal for centrifugal action,
the jaws close, the tongue assumes a downward
tendency. The trachea and the larynx, as well as
the thorax (the seat of gravitation for German vocal
utterance), obtain the preponderance, and German
may be freely spoken, while English is obstructed.</p>

<p>In <em>raising</em> the tongue, a free passage to the &#339;sophagus
is obtained, while that to the trachea is obstructed.
In <em>lowering</em> the tongue, a free passage to
the trachea is obtained, while that to the &#339;sophagus
becomes obstructed. It is necessary, however, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
understand that, while English speech is centrifugal
and German centripetal, these are <em>tendencies</em> only and
not permanent <em>conditions</em>; centrifugal and centripetal
action constantly interchanging and modifying one
another. An uninterrupted tendency in one and the
same direction, either centripetally or centrifugally,
would soon come to an end and produce stagnation,
inertia, death. There is no action without a counteraction.
Hence, ingoing vocal sounds are counterbalanced
by outgoing; the same as ingoing thoughts
or thoughts produced by external vision are counterbalanced
by outgoing, or thoughts produced by
internal vision, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the parts mentioned, there are
many other parts of the body which, subjected to
centrifugal or centripetal action, will produce results
of the same order as those already mentioned. In
stretching out your legs (while in a sitting position),
you will find speaking German to be difficult; upon
drawing them up, you will have trouble with English.
The same results may be obtained, in connection
with the toes and fingers, in a number of
different ways. From all this, it will be readily seen
that all parts of the body are closely related to each
other, the tendency of the muscles in one prominent
part producing the same tendency in all the rest.</p>

<p>There is one thing which must be mentioned,
however. To obtain centrifugal action, it is necessary
to <em>stretch</em> the part under consideration; the
mere extension of a part, without stretching it, will
be fruitless of results in either one direction or
another; so will the mere contraction of any part be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
fruitless of results, unless such contraction is complete.
You can let your arms hang down alongside
of your body and yet speak English easily; and
you can hold them out horizontally, and yet speak
German easily. In either case the contraction and
expansion must be <em>thorough</em> to produce results either
centripetally or centrifugally.</p>

<p><em>All</em> persons make similar motions to those mentioned
with every sound they utter, though these
motions do not appear on the surface; in fact, they
could not speak if they did not make them.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, but want to repeat,
that centrifugal action is the cause of the elongated
faces, and especially of the elongation of the lower
jaw of English-speaking persons. It is also the
cause of their semi-parted lips while in repose, showing
their teeth, and a full exhibition thereof while
speaking; a fact which has caused much merriment
to continental nations, and has given rise to an
endless number of caricatures of "milord" and
"milady" on their travels, etc. It is also the
cause of the perfection of dentistry in this country
and in England, where the teeth are always more or
less on exhibition. In other countries, where they
are hidden behind the curtains of the lips, which are
usually closed, except while speaking or laughing,
this necessity does not arise to nearly the same
extent. To the centrifugal force there is also due
much of the innate charm and beauty of English-speaking
women.</p>

<p>From all this one great lesson may be learned:
no matter by what divergent means nature may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
work its ends, similar results are obtained, though
often arrived at by opposite means and from opposite
directions. Thus life ever presents to us
new forms and features, and ever infuses new interest
into what otherwise might become unbearable
in its monotony. A better insight into these facts
ought to make us feel more lenient towards what
appear to us as other people's "idiosyncrasies."
It should also have a tendency to prevent us from
attempting to enforce to their full extent laws made
in conformity with our own desires and inclinations
but in direct opposition to those of others (foreigners
living among us), whose character and disposition
lead them in diametrically opposite directions.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, I wish the reader to
remember that I am always speaking not only from
the standpoint of an American, but <em>as</em> an American.
The fact of my long residence in this country, where
I have spent the best part of my life, in itself would
not entitle me to do this, having shown, as I have
endeavored to do, that this is not sufficient to change
a person from one nationality into another. During
my earnest endeavor at fathoming these differences,
however, I have been led into assuming the forms
which distinguish the Anglo-Saxon from the German.
Unless I am with Germans and speak the
German language, in my thoughts and otherwise I
lead the life of an American.</p>

<p>That my English speech, however (though my
friends in their indulgence would lead me to believe
otherwise), is not as perfect as it might be, is largely
due to the fact of my constantly having recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the German language, and that I am thus as constantly
led back into these other forms of existence
which cannot be indulged in without some detriment
and abstraction from either the one or the other.
There was a time, in fact, when the transformation
I have spoken of was taking place (the disturbance
being so great) that I could not speak well either
the one language or the other.</p>

<p>I am well convinced, on the other hand, that
through perseverance <em>perfection</em> in the utterance of
both of these languages, for speech as well as for
song, and possibly of some other languages besides,
may be attained in the course of time; nature being
so pliable that, when the required actions are once
<em>fully</em> understood and complied with, a perfect change
may be made instantly in passing from one language
on to another. Such changes, in fact, are naturally
made by persons who, in their infancy, have been
educated in and taught to speak several languages
at one and the same time; the material during infancy
being so pliable that it can be readily formed
into any shape and transformed into any other. All
of the preceding also shows that, for every separate
idiom, the <em>entire</em> instrument must be "tuned" for
its production in a given order, and that only when
so tuned can such idiom be produced in its entire
purity. It also shows that, unless so tuned, the
vocal cords of the larynx and replica cease to be
instrumental in the production of sound.</p>

<p>An instrument tuned for the production of the
English language, consequently, cannot produce
German sounds, nor can it produce Romanic, Slav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>onic,
or the sounds of any other language. Sounds,
<em>apparently</em> the same, of either the singing or speaking
voice of various languages are, therefore, <em>not</em> the
same and are certainly not produced in the same
manner. For a German, consequently, or an Italian
to attempt to teach an English-speaking person the
art of singing is an anomaly. A foreigner might,
with the same show of reason, attempt to teach persons
of another nationality the correct pronunciation
of their own language. It would be equally false,
of course, for an English-speaking person to attempt
to teach a German, Italian, etc., the art of singing,
unless he had first mastered his pupil's idiomatic
expression, or the pupil had mastered that of his
teacher.</p>

<p>Many persons are under the erroneous impression
that song and speech are performances separate and
apart from each other, while they are in reality of
precisely the same, though inverse, order. They
are of the same order, for instance, as the back and
palm of the hand: the former representing speech,
the latter song; the external and the internal, or the
anterior and the posterior. As the back of the
hand, such must and will be its palm; or, as its
palm, such must and will be its back.</p>

<p>Conversing with a teacher some time since, she
scorned such propositions, saying a person's language
had nothing to do with his or her song; the
mode of production of the latter being the <em>same</em>
with <span class="smcap">ALL</span> nationalities; besides, she had studied the
larynx, and knew all about it. This, of course,
settled it, and I had not anything further to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>


<h3>DIFFERENCE IN THEIR MODE OF BREATHING AS
BETWEEN ANGLO-SAXONS AND GERMANS</h3>

<p>Anglo-Saxons inspire first into the thorax and
then into the abdomen. Germans inspire first into
the abdomen and then into the thorax. The former
expire first from the abdomen and then from
the thorax; the latter expire first from the abdomen
and then from the thorax. This, however, gives
but a partial account of the process of breathing,
and I must postpone a more explicit one to a later
period.</p>

<p>To prove the correctness of the above assertion,
press your hand against the left side of your thorax
anteriorly, and you will find it difficult to inhale.
If you press your hand against the right side of
your thorax, on the other hand, you will have no
difficulty in inhaling. Next, press your hand
against the right side of your abdomen, and you
will not be able to exhale; but if you press your
hand against its left side, you will experience no
trouble in exhaling. In pressing your hands one
against the left side of the breast and the other
against the right side of the abdomen, you will have
trouble in breathing.</p>

<p>Pressures produced in the precisely <em>opposite</em> manner
in every respect, on the part of a German-speaking
person, will produce effects of precisely the <em>same</em>
nature. A German, in pressing the right side of
his abdomen, will not be able to inspire freely, but
pressing its left side will not hinder him from doing
so. Pressing the left side of his thorax will impede
his expiration, while the pressing of its right side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
will not prevent him from doing so. These results
will become more obvious when these pressures are
continued for some time. All the pressures mentioned
are to be applied <em>anteriorly</em>. Pressures of
the same nature applied <em>posteriorly</em> produce opposite
results with Anglo-Saxons as well as Germans.</p>

<p>Similar results may be obtained by producing
pressures on the median line of either thorax or
abdomen, front as well as back. Such will also be
the case when pressures are produced on either side
from the armpits downward or from the hips upward.
More satisfactory results, however, than
those obtained through mechanical pressure can be
obtained by making the respective parts rigid. It
will scarcely be necessary for me to mention all
these various causes and consequent results in detail,
as any one interested in these matters can work
them out for himself from that which I have said.</p>


<h3>RISE AND FALL, OR RHYTHM</h3>

<p>The thorax is productive of the falling, the abdomen
of the rising voice, the former being the representative
of the <em>impression</em> for sounds, the latter of
their expression.</p>

<p><em>An Anglo-Saxon's voice, inspiring, as he does, into
the thorax, and expiring from the abdomen, will first
fall and then rise. A German's voice, on the contrary,
inspiring, as he does, into the abdomen, and
expiring from the thorax, will first rise and then fall.</em></p>

<p>This is the fundamental cause of the difference
between the idiomatic expression of these two
peoples, and primarily also of the difference existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
between their national traits physically as well as
mentally.</p>

<p>Every original word in either of these languages
will illustrate these facts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 &acute; `    &acute;  `     &acute; `      &acute;  `
Vater, Mutter, Bruder, Schwester.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Take the same words in English, and the accent
will be reversed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 `  &acute;    `  &acute;     `  &acute;     ` &acute;
Father, Mother, Brother, Sister
</pre>
</div>
<p>When these and similar words were adopted into
the English language, it was done at the expense of
their original idiomatic expression. I am speaking
of the music, the rise and fall, the rhythm pervading
a language, not of time or measure, nor of the
intonation, nor of emphasis.</p>

<p>I make four distinctions, and expect to prove that
they are the basis of every artistic expression of
either speech or song. First, measure or time.
Second, the rise and fall of the voice, equal to its
rhythm. Third, intonation, which pertains to
words in accordance with their meaning. Fourth,
emphasis, which has reference to the feelings.</p>

<p>That the human voice is capable of at one and the
same time expressing four moods so different from
each other, shows that there are various factors
(all of a different nature) simultaneously at work
producing these different results. To correctly indicate
these four characteristics, it would be necessary
to mark each syllable in a fourfold manner. I
shall confine myself to the rhythm and the metre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and shall mark the former above the line by using
the signs for accent (&acute;`), and the latter below the
line by using those for metre (&macr;&#728;).</p>

<p>Right here is the main stumbling-block with persons
of either nationality in speaking the language
of the other. They will in so doing invariably retain
the idiomatic expression of their own vernacular.</p>

<p>The <em>proper</em> way to illustrate the rhythm would be
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 &acute;`&acute;`   &acute;` &acute;`   &acute;`
Vater, Mutter, gut.

 `&acute; `&acute;   `&acute; `&acute;   `&acute;
Father, Mother, good.
</pre>
</div>

<p>There is always a rise of the voice before its fall
in German, and a fall before its rise in English <em>for
each and every syllable</em>. When a language is well
spoken, this complete intonation is always heard.
If this needs illustration, which it should not, being
so obvious, the poetry of both peoples offers proofs
in great abundance. It is a notable fact that, with
German verse, the voice for the end syllable always
sinks, with English it rises; the former is generally
short, the latter long; but even where the word
ends with a long syllable in German the voice falls
at the end, and where one ends with a short syllable
in English the voice rises at the end.</p>

<p>To anxiously count every syllable in poetry is
contrary to the spirit of a language. There are
slight touches here and there which simply serve as
connecting links, and which, in marking the rhythmic
flow of sounds, should not be included as belonging
to the metre. Most of these are prefixes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
affixes, pauses for repose or relaxation, consisting
in scarcely noticeable inspirations or expirations,
which are necessary to strengthen the voice for the
actual metre. The various intonations are generally
expressed by the use of the signs for long and short
only. As the latter, properly speaking, only represent
time or measure, the voice is left to express as
best it may and without any guidance whatsoever
every other factor composing a language. All I
want to do now is to show by the signs for the accent
the difference between the English and German
rhythmic movement:</p>

expression proper, and being expressive mainly of
an inspiration preceding the expiration which it
foreshadows. The beauty of Heine's verse is largely
due to the fact that he does not anxiously count
time, but lets his voice rise and fall where it is most
effective. It will be noticed that there is a greater
movement, as expressed by the signs of the rhythm,
in Heine's verse than there is in Lenau's, hence the
inexpressible charm of his diction. Here is another
great poet, or poetess rather, the greatest Germany
has produced, also fearless of prescribed forms, but
full of charm and power:</p>

<p>In these last two citations, the dactylus (&macr; &#728; &#728;) is
the prevailing measure, which but strengthens my
assertion that in German diction there is a fall after
a rise; the former being here more distinctly expressed
than in the simple trochaic measure. The
fall, the relaxation, being greater, the rise, the vigor
in the expression, thereby gains additional strength.
What is the consequence of this falling off or gliding
down in German diction so well expressed in Lenau's</p>

<p>It is not a positive line of demarcation, but one
which is lost, as it were, "in the soft ether of the
evening sky."</p>

<p>Hence the high tide succeeded by the low, the
aspiration followed by resignation, the night after
the day, death after life, repose after the strife&mdash;all
this expresses the genius of the German language;
and is also expressive of German life and character&mdash;its
dreaminess, its longing, its desire for the ideal,
never to be attained; the abstract, the abstruse; its
yearning, its altruism, its transcendentalism, its
<em>Weltschmerz</em> (the sadness pervading all nature). It
is also expressive of its <em>Begeisterung</em> (an enthusiasm
which upon the slightest provocation takes a man
almost off his feet). All these are traits of the
German national character.</p>

<p>There is no spiritual bond among all these millions
that could possibly produce such sentiments
and feelings as its result, differing, as they do, from
the feelings of any other nation or people, but that
of a language common to all.</p>

<p>To prove that the trochaic measure is the one
ordained by nature for German expression, it is but
necessary to glance at the characteristic words of
the preceding verses:</p>

obtains with the words of one syllable:</p>

<p>It is either the iambic (&#728;&macr;) or the anapest (&#728;&#728;&macr;).
Of course, these vary to some extent in conformity
with the reader's intonation, but the spirit
of the language is always from weakness to strength,
in place of from strength to weakness, as with the
German. It is always the waves approaching the
shore and then <em>breaking</em> against it, as against the wind
<em>coming up suddenly</em> and then dying away. This is
the reason why a serenade or lullaby in English can
never be rendered with the same effect as in German,
the English voice rising at the end instead of falling.</p>

<p>Wherever a verse commences with a stress, it
must be considered that a fall of the voice or an inspiration
has preceded it; this, though unaccompanied
by sound, being really the case. I have thus
marked the beginning of Longfellow's beautiful
lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 ` &acute;     `&acute;     ` &acute;
Falls----as----from.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Mr. Lunn, in his <cite>Philosophy of Voice</cite>, has the
following:</p>

<p>"How many Englishmen <em>dare</em> utter loudly a
word beginning with a vowel? If attempted, either
it would not be done, or, in spite of the speaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
owing to the weakness of the muscles which draw
the cords together [<em>sic</em>], an aspirate would precede
the vowel."</p>

<p>This is right, as far as his observation is concerned,
but he does not seem to know that this very
weakness he complains of is really the strength of
the English language, the lull before the storm, the
concentration before the explosion; and that "thus
the idiosyncrasy of our people's speech" is <em>not</em>
"deadness, weakness, and general feebleness," but,
on the contrary, a strength and a virility not surpassed
by any other tongue. This finds illustration
in Kipling's</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
`&acute;  `&acute;  `&acute;  `&acute;
Oh east is east, etc.
</pre>
</div>

<p>It is but necessary to comprehend the laws which
underlie this apparent weakness to turn it to its best
account, and to obtain from it the highest results,
both for speech and song. As for the "weakness
of the muscles which draw the cords together," it
will scarcely be necessary for me to make a specific
refutation; the premises upon which such assumption
is founded being quite untenable, there being
quite as much vigor in the <em>muscles</em> and <em>cords</em> of an
Anglo-Saxon as in those of any other nation. Nor,
I suppose, will it be necessary to strengthen my
assertions by once more quoting the separate words
and thus pointing out the iambic, the rise after the
fall (&#728;&macr;), or the anapest (&#728;&#728;&macr;), the twofold repose
and gathering of strength for the final emphasis.</p>

<p>The English language in its Saxon words mainly
consists of monosyllables. These, however, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
stated, must be looked upon as words of two syllables,
a suppressed intonation always preceding
their vowel sounds. The majority of such words,
as a matter of fact, originally consisted of two
syllables, of which the last was dropped when they
were adopted by the English. This last syllable,
representing the fall of the voice thus disappearing,
left the first, which represented its rise, standing
unsupported by itself. As the rise of the voice,
however, cannot be expressed without the accompaniment
of its fall, the latter always <em>tacitly</em> accompanies
the same, and is expressed in an undertone,
<em>preceding</em> the rise.</p>

<p>Almost every verb of this class will give evidence
of this fact:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 &acute; `    &acute;   &acute; `    &acute;    &acute;  `    &acute;
Gehen--go, sehen--see, hoeren--hear,

   &acute;  `     &acute;     &acute;  `    &acute;     &acute;  `     &acute;
sprechen--speak, kochen--cook, tanzen--dance,

 &acute;  `    &acute;
fallen--fall, etc.
</pre>
</div>

<p>Hence, in conformity with the above, these words
in the English language should be properly marked
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
`&acute;   `&acute;   `&acute;     `&acute;    `&acute;     `&acute;
Go, see, hear, speak, cook, dance, etc.
</pre>
</div>

<p>which gives the real intonation thereof.</p>

<p>This applies to all words commencing with a
vowel, and explains what Mr. Lunn has designated
as a "weakness of the English language":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 `&acute;   `&acute;  `&acute;  `&acute;    `&acute;     `&acute;   `&acute;
Art, arm, or, all, eagle, each, old, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></pre>
</div>

<p>Without this half-suppressed fall of the voice,
there would be no beauty, no charm, no soul in the
English language; in fact, it could not exist.
Words of two syllables, however, always have the
fall of the voice on the first, its rise on the second,
syllable, even where the preponderance of <em>time</em> belongs
to the first syllable, as in the words</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<pre>
 `  &acute;    ` &acute;
Danced, hazel, etc.
 &macr; &#728;     &macr; &#728;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The reader will find these statements sustained by
almost every word he may examine into, which will
show that the characteristic expression of English
diction is that of the iambic measure, which passes
from weakness to strength; while that of German
diction, as already stated, is that of the trochaic
measure, which passes from strength to weakness.</p>

<p>Having shown that German <em>sentiment</em> is in accord
with the idiomatic expression of the German language,
I will now show that <em>English</em> sentiment also
conforms to <em>its</em> idiomatic expression. I must beg
the reader, however, not to be over-critical. I am
not attempting to furnish comparative sketches of
the national character of these peoples in a literary
sense, but am entering into these matters for the
sole purpose of sustaining the results of my physiological
investigations. Nor should these attempts
be applied to individual cases, there being exceptions
to all rules, but to the national character <em>in
general</em>. If a person in making investigations of
this kind had to constantly fear that he might be
treading on some one's sensitive toes, he could never
make any headway at all. I am, in fact, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
willing to apologize beforehand for any such mishap
possibly taking place, as I wish to be perfectly impartial
and without bias. I have said this much
partly for the reason also that in consequence of
some remark, on one occasion, made in my former
publication in favor of the English <em>vs.</em> the Germans,
one critic honored me with the epithet "renegade."</p>

<p>The rising voice succeeding the falling is not a
soft and gradual receding, but, on the contrary, it is
more like an explosion, a trumpet-blast; the inspiration
which had been "stored" being suddenly released.
There is no such "storing" in connection
with German diction; inspiration and expiration
succeeding each other on the spot. With English
diction this change may be compared to the break of
day after the night; the fray after the repose; resurrection
after death; a conflagration and a rebuilding
at once on the spot, not only individually, but
by an entire community (Boston and Chicago); an
outburst after due deliberation; no sentimentality,
but a firm resolve for the right; patient submission
to a point, then a strike for liberty; the slow accumulation
of a fortune and the spontaneous spending
thereof; a hot political campaign and a victory
or defeat; in either case acquiescence; no vain
mourning after the fact; a butterfly of wealth,
idleness, and fashion, then perhaps ruin; yet not
despair, but a brave conformity to altered circumstances;
an energy in the pursuit of business or of
war which does not flag until utterly exhausted or
success is achieved and a victory is won. All this is
due to the reserve force in the character of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>-speaking
people, which comes to their rescue when
circumstances demand it. A world positive and
direct, full of energy, restlessness, and activity. A
world of, and for, <em>this</em> world; whose world to come,
even, must have a positive and well-defined character
and surroundings:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>"Where the walls are made of jasper and the streets are
paved with gold."</p></div>

<p>To what is all this due but to this <em>bond of language</em>
uniting these millions, and embracing every foreign
element, in its children at least? The theme is
inexhaustible, but I am limited as to time; yet
additional remarks on the same subject will be forthcoming
during the further pursuance of these studies.</p>

<p>For song, it appears to me, the words, besides
being marked by notes, should also be marked as to
rhythm, as this would assist singers in giving them
the proper intonation; notes indicating metre, but
not rhythm.</p>

<p>Metre and rhythm are produced by two distinctly
different processes; metre, or time, being the outcome
of a mode of breathing subject to the will,
while rhythm is the outcome of an involuntary mode
of breathing for a characteristic quality inherent in
a nation's language as its idiomatic expression.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, both metre and rhythm are expressed
by the same signs (&#728;&macr;); this is very misleading.</p>

<p>To express time, or metre, I use the signs for
short and long (&#728;&macr;). To express rhythm, or the
fall and rise of the voice, I use the signs for what is
usually called the accent (&acute;`). If we were to <em>meas</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><em>ure</em>
the exact time, however, consumed in the utterance
of syllables, we would find that the falling voice,
which is the product of inspiration and belongs to
the thorax, requires more time than the rising voice,
which is the product of expiration and belongs to
the abdomen.</p>

<p>In marking verse, however, the sign for long (&macr;)
generally accompanies the short syllable of the rising,
and the sign for short (&#728;) the, as a matter of fact,
long syllable of the falling voice. It takes longer to
fill a bottle than to pour out its contents; to prepare
a dish than to eat it; to walk upstairs than to jump
from a window. It takes longer to <em>prepare</em> for an
utterance than to utter it. It takes longer to inspire
than to expire.</p>

<p>In view of the vast foreign element constituting a
part of this nation, it would be a matter of interest
to know at what period the foreigner ceases to exist
as such and the "American" begins; or, in other
words, to understand when the evolution takes place
which transforms the foreigner into the American.
From my point of view it is, above all, a question of
language. The political aspect of the case is scarcely
to be considered. An unnaturalized Englishman,
consequently, after thoroughly "Americanizing" his
language, becomes more of an American (no matter
whether he himself thinks so or not) than an Irishman
who, though naturalized, never ceases to use
his native brogue.</p>

<p>These questions, of course, are many-sided. When
I speak of nationality, however, I have the <em>best</em> specimens
of a nation as representatives thereof in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
always. A man with a foreign accent does not have
the same standing or influence in municipal, state,
and national councils as one who speaks a pure English;
there is always a <em>feeling</em> against him, no matter
how able or patriotic he may be, of some foreign
influence as a substratum in his composition.</p>


<h3>STRESS</h3>

<p>I have already stated that the thorax is the seat
of the falling, the abdomen that of the rising, voice.
This can be tested by a simple experiment, the result
of which will be as startling as it is phenomenal.
<em>By simply pressing the stomach, or making the same
rigid, you will find that the fact of your doing so will
prevent you from uttering any sound belonging to the
rising voice, or the stress laid upon a word.</em></p>

<p>Take, for instance, the following:</p>

<p class="center">"Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light,"
</p>

<p>and you will find that, upon pressing the stomach,
or making the same rigid, you will not be able to
utter the words "say," "see," "dawn's," and
"light." This will become more obvious in uttering
these words slowly than in doing so rapidly.
You will have no difficulty, on the other hand, in
uttering the rest of the words, viz.: "Oh," "can
you," "by the," "early."</p>

<p>Upon releasing the stomach and bringing a pressure
to bear upon the chest, on the other hand, you
will have no difficulty in uttering the first words
mentioned, those of the rising, while you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
unable to utter the last, those of the falling voice.
This rule holds good for all peoples and all languages.</p>

<p>There is this difference, however, as between
English and German speech, that, for the former,
the falling voice (identical with that of the thorax)
<em>precedes</em> the rising (identical with that of the abdomen);
while for the latter the reverse is the case;&mdash;Anglo-Saxons
inspiring into the chest and then
into the stomach; Germans into the stomach and
then into the chest. Germans will have greater
difficulty in making this experiment than Anglo-Saxons,
as words of the falling voice, as a rule and
in all languages, precede those of the rising. Germans,
consequently, must <em>think</em> of the word of
the rising voice, which, as a matter of fact, succeeds
the words of the falling, before they can utter
the latter. This difficulty is enhanced by the fact
that while the rising voice is generally confined to a
single word, the falling voice generally embraces
several.</p>

<p>Hence the frequency of the use of the anapest
(&#728;&#728;&macr;) and the dactylus (&macr;&#728;&#728;), and the relative
rarity of the use of the bacchius (&#728;&macr;&macr;) and the antibacchius
(&macr;&macr;&#728;); short always representing the falling
voice, which embraces more than one word, while
long represents the rising voice, which usually embraces
but one single word; the definition requiring
more words than the thing to be defined. Hence,
<em>for German diction, the "thought" of the word of
the rising voice must precede the "utterance" of the
words of the falling; while for English diction, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
"thoughts" of the words of the falling voice must
precede the "utterance" of the word of the rising.</em></p>

<p>A German may try and say the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In einem <em>Thal</em> bei armen <em>Hirten</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erschien mit jedem jungen <em>Jahr</em>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in such a manner as <em>not to think</em> of the words which
are italicized before uttering those which immediately
precede them, and he will find that he will be
unable to pronounce the latter.</p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon may try and say the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And the star-spangled banner in triumph <em>doth wave</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the land of the free and the home <em>of the brave</em>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he will find that in saying "in triumph doth
wave," he must think of the words "doth wave"
before he will be able to utter the word "triumph."
Again, in saying "the home of the
brave" he must think of the words "of the brave"
before he will be able to utter the word "home."</p>

<p>A German, consequently, must <em>think</em> of the principal
word before he can utter those which qualify
it; an Anglo-Saxon must think of the latter before
he can utter the former.</p>

<p>In place of using mechanical pressure, the same
results can be obtained by making the respective
parts rigid. Regarding this matter of <em>making parts
rigid</em>, I want to make the following explanation,
illustrating the physiological process going on in so
doing.</p>

<p>While a part is rendered inactive, placed <em>hors de
combat</em>, so to say, by the application of mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
pressure, the same result can also be obtained by
making such part rigid. To accomplish this, it is
but necessary to positively <em>think</em> of such part, to
associate your mind with it, which is equal to an
act of expiration when it relates to the abdomen,
and inspiration when it relates to the thorax. By
positively <em>thinking</em> of the abdomen, which is equal
to an expiration therefrom, you will be unable to
utter the stress or <em>rise</em> of the voice, which is the
product of an expiration from the stomach; by positively
thinking of the thorax, which is equal to an
inspiration into the same, you will be unable to utter
the <em>fall</em> of the voice, which is the product of an inspiration
into the chest. The reason is obvious:
<em>We cannot utter sound in the same direction in which
we breathe; sound and respiration always following
opposite directions.</em></p>

<p>For the purpose of making satisfactory experiments
in this respect, as, in fact, in every other respect
in connection with these investigations, it is
necessary that inspiration or expiration, as the case
may be, should be <em>continuous</em>, that is, that either the
one or the other should be persisted in until a result
is obtained; namely, until an apparent increase or
decrease in the size of the part of the body under
consideration, or an inflation or depletion of the
same, will be perceptible. Though it may be difficult
at first, a person will soon learn to distinguish between
an increase or a swelling of a part, which
means inspiration into the same, and a decrease or
a shrinking or diminution thereof, which means
expiration from the same.</p>

<h2><a name="PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_VOICE_IN_RELATION" id="PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_VOICE_IN_RELATION">PHYSIOLOGY OF THE VOICE IN RELATION
TO WORDS</a></h2>


<p>In the further pursuance of the questions heretofore
under consideration, I shall now enter upon
a theme of a still more subtle nature. The question
of metre, rhythm, accent, etc., is one which is
involved in much mystery; nor can I find that many
persons entertain precisely the same ideas as being
expressed by these terms.</p>

<p><em>Accepting as a fundamental principle the fact that
our various spiritual conditions are based upon our
ability to extract the necessary inspiration therefor
from the air, which bears the same relation to our
spiritual existence that the earth does to that of our
body (in furnishing it with such elements as it requires
for its maintenance), I contend that we breathe for
speech in as many different modes as there are parts
or elements in its composition.</em> This proposition does
not necessarily conflict with the fact that we also
draw elements from the air, as analytical chemistry
has proven, which serve for the construction of
matter; such elements, however, instead of being
strictly material, as they have every appearance of
being, are, in reality, the spiritual complements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the matter they help to form; matter and spirit
going hand in hand in our entire composition.</p>

<p>In reading poetry, or giving expression to the
same in song (I repeat), we do so in a fourfold
manner:</p>

<p>First: as to metre or time (the "measure" of
time).</p>

<p>Second: as to the rhythm or the music pervading
the voice, produced by its rise and fall, also called
cadence, or the idiomatic expression of a language.</p>

<p>Third: as to accent.</p>

<p>Fourth: as to emphasis.</p>

<p>The <em>metre</em> is produced by an artistic mode of
breathing (in addition to our ordinary and permanent
mode), marked by regular repetitions of a given
order of inspirations and expirations which can be
"measured" as to the time consumed in their
enunciation, and are therefore, not incorrectly, called
"feet."</p>

<p>The metre is a product or outcome of the <em>will</em>, a
force which presides over material-spiritual issues.
It changes with our inclinations and moods, and is
expressive thereof. We can pass from one metre
to another at will, as the occasion may require. It
is the <em>material</em> part of speech, as we can measure it
and account for it as to time in space, supposing
time to be incorporated. The metre expressive of
joy, for instance, being quick, that of sorrow slow;
the former, if incorporated, would take up less space
than the latter, in the same proportion as it consumes
less time in being uttered.</p>

<p>The <em>rhythm</em> is that characteristic quality which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
distinguishes one language from another, the basis
upon which it is built and around which all its elementary
words cluster; its fundamental principle, its
idiomatic expression, the music pervading its every
syllable; the inflection, the rise and fall, the cadence
of the voice; the spirit of a language, which is permanent
and unchangeable.</p>

<p>The rhythm is an outcome of the <em>mind</em>; an influence
which presides over <em>spiritual-material</em> issues.
As <em>harmony is the first law of nature</em>, so is that harmony
which pervades our native tongue the law
upon which our individual and national characteristic
expressions and actions are based. We exercise
it intuitively. It is innate in, and unalterably connected
with, our native tongue. It cannot be eliminated
therefrom, or put into it by a foreigner, except
when acquired in childhood, or by the study of such
principles as I have attempted to lay down in this
book. It is inborn in every language as its spirit,
and is as enduring as that language itself. It is not
subject to change by the dictates of the will.</p>

<p>The <em>accent</em> represents that element which distinguishes
between the character and meaning of words,
and has no reference to parts thereof or their relation
to other words; the same word being pronounced in
as many different ways and with as many different
<em>accents</em> as it denotes different senses or meanings;
while <em>different words, embodying the same idea, are
uttered with precisely the same accent</em>.</p>

<p>The accent or intonation is an outcome of the
<em>soul</em>; an influence which dominates over our spiritual
nature and over <em>spiritual issues</em>. "The rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by any other name would smell as sweet." It is
equally true that any other name given to the rose
would be pronounced by the same indefinable intonation
as its present name, with that same embodiment
of the mystery of the soul signifying the
flower called "a rose." The <em>word</em> "rose," which
is the same, or nearly the same, in so many different
languages, though possessing the same <em>spiritual</em> elements
in them all, varies as to measure and rhythm
in every one of them.</p>

<p>If the influence of the soul, embodying an idea in
a word, through the intonation we give it, were not
the same for <em>all</em> languages, it would not be possible
to translate poetry, and retain, to some extent at
least, that which is commonly called "the rhythm"
of the original; nor would it be possible to sing a
song in another language, and retain, even approximately,
the spiritual elements of the original. We
would not be impressed with it, would not be
<em>thrilled</em> by it.</p>

<p><em>The intonation of a word, expressive of the soul in
the embodiment of an idea, is a bond which unites
all humanity</em>; not alone the human souls of any
special day and generation, but of all days and all
generations. But for the fact that the Greek soul
is in us to-day, that the native intonation of <em>their</em>
words is native with us and with <em>all</em> mankind, their
<em>dead</em> tongue would be <em>absolutely</em> dead for us. We
could find no meaning in it, no beauty, no spirit, no
soul. Think of the melody pervading the soul of
Homer and emanating from <em>his</em> lyre still living and
finding an echo in <em>our</em> souls! Think of the harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
pervading the soul of Schiller or Tennyson continuing
to live, and pervading the souls of the latest
generations! Nor could Luther's famous translation
of the Bible or its beautiful English version
ever have been produced, and after production have
made the same impression on the mind, or been read
with the same expression of the voice, as the words
of this same Bible made upon the minds, and were
expressed by the voice, of its original composers,
but for the fact <em>that words of the same meaning</em>, <em>in
every language</em> (aside from metre and rhythm), <em>are
pronounced precisely the same</em>. It is this universal
comprehension of their beauty which gives immortality
to the strains of great singers, whether they
appear in their original form or are translated (that
is, if well translated) into foreign languages, or are
set to music and sung either in the one or the other.</p>

<p>If the performances of creating original compositions
and their translations were of a mere mechanical
order, or were explainable from a mechanical
standpoint, no such soul effects could ever be produced.
The word, as such, is a <em>mechanical</em> contrivance;
but its intonation is of the soul, being an
emanation of the idea it represents. If our ears were
so schooled that by <em>their "intonation" we could comprehend
the meaning of words</em>, we could understand
every language upon simply hearing it spoken.</p>

<p>The people of all nations, through their eyesight,
form the same conception of an object; the same
being impressed upon all minds in the same manner.
When a picture thus impressed upon the mind (brain)
is reproduced by, or is translated into, vocal utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ance,
it continues to remain the same with all people.
This does not refer to impressions made by material
objects alone, but extends to immaterial subjects as
well. Hence, knowing the meaning of a word in
one language, we can at once conjure up the idea it
represents in all languages.</p>

<p>The sight, however, not only impresses our minds
through the eye with a given picture, but, as there
is a correlation existing between all our faculties, it
also impresses the voice with a given inflection, expressive
of such impression upon the mind, and of
no other impression; any given sight or mental conception
of any kind always producing an inflection of
the voice corresponding therewith. The vocal expression
of an idea might thus be called an <em>audible</em>
"photographic" reproduction of the impression
made by the original object upon the eyesight, and,
respectively, upon the brain, or it might be called a
phonographic reproduction thereof, supposing that
the picture of an object could be impressed upon
the wax and could thus become audible. How
such a reproduction may be made from an <em>immaterial</em>
subject would be more difficult to comprehend.
Of the fact, however, that an impression from abstract
subjects <em>is</em> made, and that an audible expression
of such impression is produced through the
voice, and that this is the case with all people alike,
I expect to furnish positive proof in a future publication.
The fact of our not being accustomed to
distinguish in this manner between various expressions
through inflections of the voice is no proof
that they do not exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The soul impresses every word with a seal of its
own, characteristic of the idea it embodies, there
being as many accents or inflections of the voice as
there are <em>separate ideas</em>, or, rather, <em>groups of ideas</em>.
I beg leave to copy the following from the <cite>Saturday
Evening Post</cite> of April 8, 1899:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. Kipling recently told an interviewer: 'We write,
it is true, in letters of the alphabet; but, psychologically
regarded, every printed page is a picture book; every
word, concrete or abstract, is a picture. The picture
itself may never come to the reader's consciousness, but
deep down below, in the unconscious realms, the picture
works and influences us.'"</p></div>

<p>The accent is not subject to the will any more
than the rhythm. The will can do <em>this</em>, however:
it can give greater weight, force, and expression,
and a wider scope, to the correlated forces of
metre, rhythm, and accent, through the</p>

<p><em>Emphasis</em> which it infuses into them. Through
the emphasis, inlet upon inlet is opened, an additional
stream of fresh air is infused into them, flooding
the spiritual system. Valve upon valve is then
opened to let it out. Hence, emphasis is not an
"element" of speech proper, but an amplification,
an addition to existing elements, rather, impregnating
them with the life of the heart, the feelings,
the emotions.</p>

<p>In distinguishing in this manner, as I have in the
above, between the will, the mind, and the soul, I
consider them parts of a great spiritual system intimately
connected with corresponding parts of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
physical system, but lay no claim as to the correctness
of the <em>terms</em> I have used. On the contrary, I
feel that they are inadequate, and, at most, a makeshift
for more fitting expressions. There is a dearth
of expressional terms, and I am doing the best I can
with such as are at my disposal.</p>

<p>In the same sense, also, I distinguish between
material-spiritual, spiritual-material, and spiritual
issues; and consider them the outcome, respectively,
of the will, the mind, and the soul.</p>

<p>I wish it were in my power to at once fully explain,
as far as I am able to offer any explanation
at all, how it is <em>mechanically</em> possible to express these
four elements of metre, rhythm, accent, and emphasis
(so widely differing from each other) at one and
the same time, by four different modes of breathing,
carried on simultaneously, in addition to our
regular mode of breathing. The <em>perfection</em> of
elocution and of singing is to carry on all these
various processes simultaneously in as perfect
a manner as the subject and the occasion may
demand.</p>

<p>I can explain the preceding, in part at least, as
follows:</p>

<p>Verse is generally marked by the signs of long
and short. While they denote time or metre in the
first instance, they are also used to mark what is
called "rhythm." Yet, while metre and rhythm
are <em>apparently</em> of the same order, they are, as a
matter of fact, invariably of an inverse order.</p>

<p>We cannot produce two distinctly different expressions
while breathing in one and the same direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
While we breathe for metre in one direction, we
breathe for rhythm in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Regarding that mode of breathing expressive of
the soul, and pertaining to words in conformity with
their <em>meaning</em>, and which, in the absence of any
more significant word, I have called the "accent,"
it is of an altogether different order and does not conflict
with these other modes of breathing.</p>

<p>Having stated that rhythm and accent are involuntary
productions, and that metre alone is subject
to the will, we must look to the metre, measure, or
time for our guide in our artistic vocal performances.
To this, emphasis must be added, as being
likewise subject to the will.</p>

<p>As every language has its own time, or tempo,
and cannot be properly produced except in conformity
therewith, it appears to me that it should be
the first aim of vocal science <em>to ascertain the exact
nature of such tempo</em> for every separate language.
<em>When the correct time is kept, all other component
parts of speech fall into line correctly and involuntarily.</em>
Just what the proportionate tempo is for
English as against German vocal utterance, I am
unable to say, but it is much quicker for the latter
than it is for the former.</p>

<p>There is a duality existing between metre and
rhythm: the former is voluntary, the latter involuntary.
Thus, also, is there a duality between emphasis
and accent, of which the former is voluntary,
the latter involuntary. Every voluntary factor, not
only in vocal utterance, but every voluntary factor
in any artistic performance of whatsoever nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
being sustained by an involuntary counter-factor;
the same as voluntary and involuntary muscles complement
and sustain each other.</p>

<p>Not only every artistic performance, but I dare
say <em>every</em> act or action of any kind, is of a dual nature.
Every separate duality, again, being sustained
by a counter-duality, every performance is sustained
by four different factors.</p>

<p>When an act is of a material nature and belongs
to the hemisphere of the abdomen, it is sustained
by four counter-factors belonging to the thorax.
When it is of an immaterial nature and belongs to
the hemisphere of the thorax, it is sustained by four
counter-factors having their seat in the abdomen.
Thus every act or action consists of eight movements,
or an <em>octave</em> of movements.</p>


<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORD "SCHOOL" IN CONNECTION
WITH THE ART OF SINGING</h3>

<p>Having established the fact that the rhythmic
movements for English and German vocal expression
are directly opposed to each other, the one being
represented by the iambic, the other by the trochaic
measure, there is still a wide field open for investigation
as to the idiomatic expression of other
languages. This it should not be difficult to determine;
personally, I cannot devote the necessary
time to this subject even as far as I might be able to
do so in connection with other languages of which I
have some knowledge. The differences in other
tongues, of course, must be embodied in either of the
two measures named, as these embrace all others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Whatever may constitute a nation's idiomatic expression
must spring from a variation of either of
these. While the precedence is given to the abdomen
in some and to the thorax in others, the point
of gravitation, which according to its location calls
for the special manner in which we inspire into and
expire from either the one or the other, establishes
such variation in the idiomatic expression of <em>all</em>
tongues.</p>

<p>All that is said about an Italian, a German, or
any other "school" (with the exception, perhaps,
of what may constitute the difference between what
is called "the <em>old</em> and the <em>new</em> Italian school," and
which covers issues of a nature foreign to these investigations)
has its proper significance right here:
There is no "school" in the sense in which this word
is ordinarily used. There are nations and there are
languages belonging to such nations. Each nation's
language is that nation's "school," and no one
nation can go to school with any other nation.</p>

<p>Peasants and the mass of the people generally in
Italy, France, Germany, etc., do not visit academies
to study vocal art, yet their mode of expression is
precisely the same as that of the best vocal artists of
these respective countries. I do not mean to say,
of course, that the raw material their voices is made
up of is as rarefied and artistically trained, but that
the composition, the fundamental element thereof,
is of precisely the same order as that of their most
finished artists. This raw material, on the other
hand, in every instance, varies from that of people
belonging to every other nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The best thing, therefore, to be done, to bring
such vocal material as nature has endowed one with
up to its greatest perfection, is to have it "schooled"
by artists belonging to one's own nation. There may
be a time coming, and the same may not be far distant,
when methods may be taught by which one
may become acquainted with the spirit, and learn
the exact mode of the technical expression, of other
nations besides one's own. It will then become
possible to comprehend these foreign methods and
to profit by comprehending them. As long as the
principles upon which they are based, however, are
not understood, any attempt at singing according to
the same will be futile as an accomplishment or an
art, and <em>hurtful</em> to the voice of the person making
the attempt.</p>

<p><em>Such person will only injure his or her own natural
mode of expression, without acquiring the foreign
mode</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of learning a certain mode of expression,
the Italian, for instance, for singing, and applying
it to <em>all</em> tongues, is futile and contrary to all reason.
We might, with as much show of reason, say that
by learning to pronounce one foreign tongue we
may apply that knowledge to the pronunciation of
every other foreign tongue.</p>

<p>The true state of affairs, and the only one to
follow, is, and always will be, this: First, and above
all, learn to use your own tongue thoroughly, for
<em>all</em> purposes of vocal expression. Then learn the
use of other tongues for vocal expression in those
other tongues only. You cannot apply the techni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>cal
mode of Italian expression to English vocal utterance
any more than you can apply the technical
mode of English expression to Italian vocal utterance.
An attempt at so doing is quite as preposterous
in the one case as it is in the other.</p>

<p>Besides, for the purpose of singing in his own
tongue, an Anglo-Saxon does not and should not
want to acquire any other mode, as he is by nature
in possession of one of the <em>best</em> modes of expression.
There is none intrinsically purer, none possessed of
more vigor or power of expression. There are
those with greater softness combined with purity,
but lacking strength, as the Italian; and those with
more soulfulness combined with strength, but lacking
purity, as the German. This native element
of purity allied to strength in the Anglo-Saxon,
more especially in the English-American, mode of
expression is primarily the cause of the high position
in the artistic world of the American singer. I
ascribe the superiority of the "American" mode of
expression over the "English," when untrammelled
as in song, in part to the greater personal liberty,
the greater want of conventionality, the vast extent
of our territory, and our almost constantly clear and
unclouded sky; all these being conditions that assist
the free exercise of one's natural endowments.
To reach the best results in the art of singing, the
body as well as the soul must be, as far as possible,
untrammelled in any direction. While the idiomatic
expression of the English language here and
abroad is the same, the social restraint and the conservatism
of the English as a nation act against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
best outcome of their gift of song, which demands
for its best expression freedom from conventionality
or any other constraint.</p>

<p>Each nation is at its best in its own tongue.
Our orators are equal to any there are in the
world. They do not speak according to the Italian,
the German, or any other school. If they did, they
would utterly fail and make themselves ridiculous.
Why do people, then, want to "speak" in this
more expansive and soulful manner, called "singing,"
in these foreign modes? I know the answer
will be that singing and speaking are things quite
apart, having no affinity in their mode of production.
I shall show, as I have already partly shown,
that they are of precisely the <em>same order</em>, though
different phases of that order; that they cannot be
separated; in so far as the elements which belong to
speech also belong to song, and those which belong
to song also belong to speech; but that they are
used in an inverse order in the former as well as in
the latter.</p>

<p>Listen to a person breathing just before falling
asleep, in a slow, rhythmical order; material objects
retire into the background and assume a semi-spiritual
shape. This is a similar condition to the
one we are in and in which we breathe during the
production of song. [By the by, sleep can be induced
by thinking of a song, that is, by mentally singing
it]. No two nations, however, breathe just alike
in that condition, any more than they do during
their waking moments; the mode of breathing during
sleep being a reversion always of the one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
obtains during our waking moments. Our mode of
breathing, however, <em>always</em> determines our mode of
vocal utterance. We can reverse our voice, as we
do in whispering, but it is always the same voice,
as a garment is the same when we turn it inside out.</p>

<p>Do you know, by the way, that the English whispering
voice is the German speaking, and the German
whispering the English speaking voice? Try
it, and you will find it so. Go on whispering; that
is, continue to use your voice in the <em>same</em> mechanical
manner, but instead of for whispering, use it for
speaking aloud, and you will have the exact mode
of the other tongue. An Anglo-Saxon, in so doing,
will be able to speak German aloud, but not English;
a German will be able to speak English, but
not German.</p>

<p>Thinking and speaking are of one and the same
order. Thought makes the impression of which
speech is the expression. If this were not the case,
it would not be possible to pass from thinking to
speaking or from speaking to thinking at once, and
without an effort. To produce English speech, we
must think English in a material way, that is, anteriorly,
and in so doing produce an instrument
from which English material or speech sounds emanate.
To produce English song, we must think
English in a spiritual way, that is, posteriorly, and
in so doing produce an instrument from which English
spiritual or song sounds emanate. We cannot
think English in either of these two ways and produce
German or Italian sounds for speech or song;
nor can we produce the latter sounds in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
manner than by <em>thinking</em>, either materially or spiritually,
in these languages, and in the proper idiomatic
manner inherent therein.</p>

<p>How can an English-speaking person, physically
and spiritually formed for English expression, and for
no other expression, produce proper Italian sounds?
She will think Italian in an English way; and, while
singing Italian words, produce them with an English
expression. That is not singing Italian, however,
but English. Is it likely that she will succeed in
acquiring the Italian mode of expression while her
teacher himself is ignorant of just what that mode
consists in, and in what it differs from the native
mode of vocal expression of his scholar? You might
as well attempt to produce on a violin the sounds of
a violoncello or some other instrument.</p>

<p>To illustrate the power of the natural voice, it will
but be necessary to call attention to what occurs in
almost any concert wherein one of America's own
daughters, now "<em>prima donna assoluta</em>," is the main
performer. She sings a grand aria, the work of an
Italian master, highly artistically and perfectly rendered.
Musicians are delighted; the public applauds.
She re&euml;nters, and now the <em>donna</em>, changed
to a simple American, sings one of England's or
America's own songs. The audience, which before
had been languidly listening, at the first notes of this
song is stirred, electrified, and now listens intently.
When she ceases to sing, there is a storm of applause,
as to almost shake the house. Where the artistic
sense alone had been engaged before, the hearts and
the souls of her hearers have now been touched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Yet I have seen the eccentric Von Buelow deliberately
take out his handkerchief after such a
demonstration and wipe the "desecration" of the
"ditty" from the keys of the piano which had
accompanied the song, before he deigned to dignify
it with one of his "classic" renderings. No doubt
he had much contempt for it all: the song, the
singer, and the public. The treasures of that
"ditty," however, were of an order similar to those
hidden within the breast of every one composing
that audience. The pearls, floating through the
room from the lips of one of its own daughters,
had, with a sympathetic touch, stirred it to its very
depths, while the foreign "aria" had left it comparatively
cold. Supposing an <em>Italian</em> singer were
to sing an English "aria" in the English language
to an Italian audience, and, after that, were to produce
one of her own simple Italian songs, would not
the effect be the same? Would Italians, in fact,
care to listen to her English interpretation, no matter
how artistically rendered?</p>

<p>It is an entirely different thing, however, for German
or Italian singers to come here and sing their
own songs in their own native tongue. Though
foreign, the production is genuine. They sing what
belongs to them, that in which they live, breathe;
they sing their own soul. Such a performance we
can comprehend and appreciate, even as we view a
foreigner with interest, and honor him for that
which is great and good in him, and for which he is
distinguished. We can soon <em>feel</em> what is genuine
and also that which is not; the former being nature's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
own production, the latter imitated, forced&mdash;unnatural.
Italians do not sing English or German
songs; why should Germans and English-speaking
people sing Italian and French songs, to the exclusion,
very often, of their own?</p>

<p>It was but recently that I heard a German choral
society sing German songs to a delighted American
audience. Then came something weird, strange; it
was German, yet the words were not German.
Looking at the programme, it turned out to be the
famous plantation song, "'Way down upon the
Suwannee River." The audience looked bewildered;
there was no applause, though, judging by the attitude
of the singers, they had expected to make this
the grand hit of the evening.</p>

<p>The last performance of the great festival of the
United German singers in Philadelphia, in 1897, was
the production of the "Star-Spangled Banner."
Everything in the appearance of the singers showed
that this finale was to be the crowning act of the
entire festival. All the singers, male and female,
participated, and "Old Glory" was waved in the
air during the performance. But, as I had feared,
it was a complete failure. Instead of the vast audience
spontaneously rising to its feet and being
carried away by enthusiasm, it remained cold and
indifferent, and there was no applause commensurate
with what it would have been had the performers
sung the words with the true ring in them and the
true English accent. The same thing would happen
if the "Marseillaise" were sung in France, or
the "Wacht am Rhein" in Germany, by foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
singing societies, no matter how excellently schooled,
and how artistically rendered.</p>

<p>A similar experience was had by Madame Brinkerhoff,
who relates the same in <cite>The Vocalist</cite> of December,
1896, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To show how language is imbedded in the <em>timbre</em> of
the voice, I will relate an incident of last season. On
the first night of the representation of the 'Scarlet Letter,'
by Damrosch, sung by German singers, I was not
surprised or in the least displeased at hearing this beautiful
opera sung with the German <em>timbre</em> of voice; but
after listening to a whole act, I heard no German words;
I listened in vain for the shaping of their consonants and
vowels, although I heard the German sounds or <em>timbres</em>.
So I asked the lady seated next to me what language the
people on the stage were singing. 'German,' she replied.
I said: 'But I hear no German words. Will you kindly
listen and tell me when you hear German words?' She
listened and replied, 'No, I do not hear German words,
but I thought before it was German.' She asked me if
it was English. We could not decide it until the lights
were turned on, and looked at the programme, which
read, 'sung in English.'</p>

<p>"This summer I asked a distinguished singer and
teacher of Philadelphia in what language the 'Scarlet
Letter' was sung in that city. She replied, 'Oh, German,
of course.' 'Did you hear it?' I asked. 'Yes,
and I enjoyed it very much, and it was sung in German,'
she replied. 'It said in English on the programme,' I
said. 'Well, if I was fooled, a great many more were
fooled&mdash;beside myself, all our party thought so too.
What are you going to do about it?' Gounod says: 'I
did not like Italian singing; their tones were attacked so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
differently from the French method of singing that it was
unpleasant at first, but I went again and again, for I could
not stay away. I enjoyed it so much.'"</p></div>

<p>This is what Frau Johanna Gadski had to say in
an interview printed in <cite>Werner's Magazine</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have never had any lessons in acting. The director
of the Choral Opera told me at the outset that it was better
to act by feeling when singing than by instruction.
If one studies only acting and singing, one is not always
natural. That is the reason why one who does not speak
German does not understand the German people and
their spirit, is not a German, and cannot sing the Wagner
r&ocirc;les. One must have the German spirit. Sometimes
you write here in your papers that German singers
cannot sing. I think they sing German r&ocirc;les very well.
One must sing, act, and, above everything, feel at the
same time, and then one can speak to the heart of the
listener."</p></div>

<p>Singing in a foreign tongue is, and must be, and
always will be (until these things are more thoroughly
understood), to a large extent, simply mechanical.
Until then, the soul-stirring depth (<em>der Zauber</em>) of
the native composition will always be wanting.
The Anglo-Saxon race has been altogether too dependent
upon European continental nations for its
examples, its support, and its development in <em>all</em>
branches of art. This has been more particularly
the case in regard to music and song. Though German
music, for obvious reasons, which give Germans
the preponderance on this field of art, ranks first
among nations, still there should be among Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>lish-speaking
nations a greater native development
thereof in harmony with the national expression.</p>

<p><em>Song</em>, above all, must be national; it must be in
harmony with the <em>genius</em> of a nation to attain its
highest development. It is too closely allied to a
nation's speech to be separated therefrom without
doing violence to both its music and its meaning.
The music and the words <em>must go together</em>; their
union is as indispensable as it is indissoluble. While
we have excellent vocal material in this country, it
lacks the proper food for its nourishment. There
is no want of poetic compositions. No nation has
their superior, or has them in greater abundance.
We have the words and the singers; but there is a
woful lack of a higher class of compositions for
singing. The latter are not at all commensurate
with the abundance and the superiority of the talent
that is awaiting their appearance.</p>

<p>With compositions on a par with its vocal talent,
this nation might rank first among nations in the
art of singing. It must stand on its own footing. It
must sing its own songs and must be taught by its
own teachers. This dictum may provoke indignation
in "foreign" vocal teachers. Though I
regret the possible consequences to them, this cannot
be helped. Science is synonymous with knowledge,
and knowledge with truth, and "the truth
must be told if the heavens should fall."</p>


<h3>BREATHING</h3>

<p>All of the preceding, in a manner, may be said to
be a preliminary argument for the great truth I claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to have discovered, namely, that <em>in the sphere of
the trunk of our body the material part of our nature
is represented by the hemisphere of the abdomen, its
immaterial part by that of the thorax; that in the
sphere of the head a similar division obtains, in conformity
with which it is also divided into hemispheres
representing material and immaterial issues; and that
every faculty, and the exercise thereof, have their being
in a dual action, in close succession, emanating
from these hemispheres.</em></p>

<p>The first proposition to be proven was that we
breathe through the &#339;sophagus, conjointly with
the trachea. If all I have said in the preceding has
not already convinced the reader of the truth of this
statement, I trust the following experiments will
thoroughly convince him thereof. These experiments
will also furnish additional proof of the fact
that English and German modes of respiration are
of an inverse order.</p>

<p>Not the slightest fear need be entertained as to
the result of these experiments. I have made the
same, and others of a similar nature, over and over
again, without being in the least discomfited thereby;
and I may add that to the fact of having been
entirely divested of fear, I largely owe my success
in all these undertakings.</p>

<p>If you are an Anglo-Saxon, and make the muscles
of your throat rigid, thereby stopping inspiration
through the trachea into the thorax, you will soon
experience a decided movement of the abdomen, in
conformity with which it will first expand anteriorly,
then posteriorly, and again anteriorly. There will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
now be a pause, after which the abdomen will be
first expanded posteriorly, then anteriorly, and
again posteriorly. This is as far as you can go; you
will be compelled to release your hold on your throat
after these six movements; the thorax meanwhile
remaining passive.</p>

<p>Upon next making the muscles of the back of
your neck rigid, equal to those of the &#339;sophagus,
the latter being thereby closed to respiration, you
will soon experience a decided movement of the
thorax, by which it will be first expanded posteriorly,
then anteriorly, and again posteriorly.
There will now be a pause, after which the thorax
will be first expanded anteriorly, then posteriorly,
and again anteriorly.</p>

<p>These twelve movements constitute one act of
respiration during which inspiration and expiration
for thorax and abdomen equalize each other. The
first three movements of the abdomen, consisting of
an inspiration, an expiration, and an inspiration,
constitute what is commonly called an inspiration;
the second three movements of the abdomen, consisting
of an expiration, an inspiration, and an
expiration, constitute what is commonly called an
expiration. Of the six movements of the thorax
succeeding these, the first three, consisting of an
inspiration, an expiration, and an inspiration, are
equal to an inspiration; the last three, consisting of
an expiration, an inspiration, and an expiration, are
equal to an expiration. We thus have four complete
respirations, two of which, equal to an inspiration
and an expiration, belong to the abdomen; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
two, likewise equal to an inspiration and an expiration,
belong to the thorax.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as each of these four respirations is
composed of three separate movements, one complete
respiration consists of twelve separate movements
of the respiratory organs. This relates to our
ordinary mode of breathing. For vocal utterance,
more especially the utterance of a vocal sound, these
four respirations are first made for the impression,
and are then, in an inverse order, repeated for the
expression. This gives us eight movements, or an
<em>octave</em> of movements, for each vocal sound; these
eight movements, as a matter of fact, consisting of
twenty-four separate movements of the respiratory
organs. These movements, which in our experiment
were of relatively long duration, during our
ordinary mode of breathing follow upon one another
very rapidly; thorax and abdomen, which during
our experiment were restrained, ordinarily and when
unrestrained, acting and reacting upon one another
in quick succession.</p>

<p>The preceding experiment gives us the following
result:</p>

<p>All of the preceding has reference to the Anglo-Saxon
mode of breathing.</p>

<p>Germans, under the same circumstances, will make
movements of an inverse order.</p>

<p>The first movement of the abdomen will be posterior,
the next anterior, the third posterior, which
will be succeeded by anterior, posterior, and anterior
ones; while the movements of the thorax will be
anterior, posterior, and anterior, succeeded by posterior,
anterior, and posterior ones. This shows
that <em>with Germans, expiration antecedes inspiration</em>,
while <em>with Anglo-Saxons, inspiration antecedes
expiration</em>.</p>

<p>In our experiment, with Anglo-Saxons, <em>inspiration</em>
took place in the abdomen by two movements
anteriorly to one posteriorly, and in the thorax by
two movements posteriorly to one anteriorly; while
<em>expiration</em> took place by two movements of the
abdomen posteriorly to one anteriorly, and in the
thorax by two movements anteriorly to one posteriorly,
as per this schedule:</p>

<p>In the case of a German, it would have been more
proper, for our experiment, to have <em>first</em> closed the
muscles to the &#339;sophagus, and then those to the
trachea, as Germans first breathe into the &#339;sophagus
and then into the thorax. Had this been done, the
result would have been inverse to that of our experiment,
as follows: The first movement of the thorax
would have been one of inspiration, the same as the
first movement of the abdomen; and the second
movement of the thorax would have been one of
expiration, the same as the second movement of the
abdomen, thus:</p>

<p><em>This shows that the movements of the abdomen are
the reverse of those of the thorax</em>:</p>

<p>With <em>Anglo-Saxons</em>, in such a manner that, while
for the abdomen <em>inspiration</em> takes place anteriorly,
it takes place for the thorax posteriorly; and that,
while for the abdomen <em>expiration</em> takes place posteriorly,
it takes place for the thorax anteriorly;</p>

<p>With <em>Germans</em>, in such a manner that, while for
the thorax <em>inspiration</em> takes place anteriorly, it takes
place for the abdomen posteriorly; and that, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for the thorax <em>expiration</em> takes place posteriorly, it
takes place for the abdomen anteriorly.</p>

<p>These various modes of breathing find an illustration
in the following:</p>

<p>Anglo-Saxons, while carrying a burden (for which
purpose it is necessary to hold the breath or to
economize the same as much as possible), inspire into
the abdomen anteriorly and the chest posteriorly,
and in so doing expand the same accordingly; while
Germans, under the same circumstances, breathe into
and expand the abdomen posteriorly and the chest
anteriorly. The action of the former tending away
from the diaphragm, that of the latter tending
towards it, exercise an influence on the spinal column
which causes Anglo-Saxons while carrying a
burden to assume an erect, Germans a stooping
position. This has already been illustrated by calling
attention to the difference between the position
of the Greek and Gothic caryatides, the former representing
the Anglo-Saxon, the latter the German
mode of breathing. The order for German soldiers,
"Brust heraus, Bauch herein"! ("Breast out, belly
in"), for Anglo-Saxons should be, "Breast in, belly
out"! The former gives German soldiers that stiff
appearance, tending towards the diaphragm, of
which Heine has said:</p>

<span class="i0">"Als haetten sie verschluckt den Stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Womit man sie einst gepruegelt."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">("As if the stick they'd swallowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which they once were walloped.")<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fact that inspiration always consists in an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>spiration,
an expiration, and an inspiration, while expiration
consists in an expiration, an inspiration, and
an expiration, is one of the most interesting observations
I have made in connection with these studies.</p>

<p>These facts may be generalized in saying: There
is no action connected with life which consists of
a single movement in any one single direction;
every action, of whatsoever nature, if it is outgoing,
consisting of an outgoing, ingoing, and outgoing
movement; if it is ingoing, of an ingoing, outgoing,
and ingoing movement; every superior movement
consisting of a superior, an inferior, and a superior;
every inferior, of an inferior, a superior, and an inferior
one; every left movement, of one to the left,
to the right, and to the left; every right movement,
of one to the right, to the left, and to the right; the
last movement <em>only</em> being visible and accompanying
action.</p>

<p>While our experiment is representative of the
general principles underlying our mode of breathing,
the act of breathing, proper, is subject to many
variations. During their waking moments, or for
conversation, with Anglo-Saxons respiration takes
place by thorax and abdomen changing off, alternately,
while with Germans they succeed one
another in the same manner as they did in our
experiment, commencing, however, with the thorax
instead of with the abdomen, and with expiration
instead of with inspiration, as follows:</p>

<p>This shows an indirect movement for Anglo-Saxon,
a direct movement for German respiration. Hence,
English enunciation is necessarily slow, German
relatively quick. It also shows that the reserve
force with Anglo-Saxons is held before it is expended;
with Germans it is expended almost as fast
as it is engendered.</p>

<p>As there is an apparent discrepancy between the
last schedule and the previous one showing Anglo-Saxon
mode of inspiration, I want to remind the
reader that our "experiment" was made mainly to
set forth the fact that we breathe through the &#339;sophagus
conjointly with breathing through the
trachea; but it was not intended to show our regular
mode of breathing.</p>

<p>Though Germans and Anglo-Saxons breathe in
opposite directions, still there is an affinity between
them in so far as they breathe <em>along the same plane</em>.
Peoples who speak any of the Latin tongues, on the
other hand, breathe along a different plane, and so
do Slavonic, Mongolian, and other races. Anglo-Saxons
and Germans, therefore, though opposed to
one another in one sense, are affiliated in another;
and both may be, therefore, as they often are, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
to belong to the Teutonic race, together with other
peoples along the borders of the North and Baltic
Seas. In a similar manner, no doubt, other races
possess their similitudes and dissimilarities.</p>

<p>It should scarcely require any further proof on
my part after this and all I have previously said to
show that, if any of the peoples now speaking Latin
tongues were in place thereof to speak English or
German, they would, in the course of time, cease
to be Frenchmen, Spaniards, or Italians, as the case
might be, and would become Anglo-Saxons or Germans;
or that, if any of the Slavonic races or peoples
would do the same, the same result would eventually
ensue; and also that, if Anglo-Saxon or German
peoples were to speak Latin or Slavonic tongues in
place of their own, they would eventually cease to
be Anglo-Saxons or Germans, and would become
the people whose tongue they were speaking; always
provided, of course, that such tongues were to be
spoken <em>idiomatically</em> correctly. Should any one still
doubt that language is the mainspring formulating
peoples and nations in all that essentially belongs
to them and distinguishes them as such, I confidently
believe that that which I shall still further
have to say on this subject will eventually convince
even the most obdurate of the correctness of these
assertions.</p>

<p>The preceding schedules both for English-and
German-speaking peoples show their mode of
breathing during their waking moments and for the
purpose of conversation. During sleep and for the
demands of the singing voice, however, thorax and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
abdomen interchange with one another in so harmonious
a manner that their inspirations and expirations
appear as one respective inspiration and
expiration.</p>

<p>The following schedules will show the relation of
metre and rhythm to breathing.</p>

<p>Inspiration being of longer duration than expiration,
I have in the following signified the former by
the sign for long (&macr;), the latter by that for short (&#728;);
while for the rise of the voice I have used the sign
for acute (&acute;), and for its fall that for grave (`); for
comparison, see schedule on page <a href="#Page_202">202</a>.</p>

<p>An experiment may be made by an Anglo-Saxon
adopting the German mode of breathing and then
attempting to speak English, or by a German adopting
the Anglo-Saxon mode of breathing and then
attempting to speak German, which neither will
succeed in doing.</p>

<p>In making the experiments just now under consideration,
it will <em>not</em> be necessary, after closing the
muscles of the trachea or the &#339;sophagus for the first
six movements, to continue doing so, as the next
six movements will ensue involuntarily. There may
be several repetitions of these twelve movements
involuntarily or automatically following after that;
any special mode of breathing once assumed being
apt to continue indefinitely until another mode is
inaugurated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The same experiments may also be made by making
<em>abdomen and thorax</em> alternately <em>rigid</em>, or producing
a state of rigidity through mechanical pressure,
in place of producing it with the muscles of the
&#339;sophagus and the trachea. As this may appear
simpler and "less dangerous," there should be
nothing to hinder any one from making these experiments.
The movements will not be as <em>pronounced</em>,
however, in the latter instance as they are
in producing a <em>direct</em> closure of the trachea and the
&#339;sophagus.</p>

<p>There is a fourth mode of producing the same
results, namely, through the simple act of <em>continuously</em>
"thinking" of any particular part. We may
thus bring about a closure of the muscles of the
trachea or &#339;sophagus, of thorax or abdomen, etc.;
thought, which <em>precedes</em> motion for vocal utterance,
<em>always</em>, as cause to effect, being the final arbiter in
all matters of respiration, unless the latter is of an
involuntary and simply functional character. While
the act of breathing for life pursues its even tenor,
breathing for vocal utterance, though of the same
<em>order</em>, is subject to innumerable changes in conformity
with the sound, syllable, or word intended
to be produced.</p>

<p>I am aware that there may be <em>apparent</em> incongruities
in some of the preceding, and I presume there
always will be. We can see things only from our
limited standpoint. I have undertaken to solve
matters supposed to be superhuman, or "of God,"
and hence <em>perfect</em> in their way, in a human, and
therefore imperfect, manner. Our limitations natu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>rally
extending to our power of observation, the
duality of our nature in matters of this kind does
not permit us&mdash;I might say, forbids us&mdash;arriving at
<em>final</em> conclusions. We can go as far as our understanding
permits us to go&mdash;beyond that, we may at
most indulge in speculation. I have limited myself
to my limits, to what I could prove, and have but
rarely indulged in what I could not&mdash;in speculation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Since the above was written Dr. G. E. Brewer, who in
conjunction with Dr. F. C. Ard, last month (March, 1899), in New
York, successfully performed the very rare operation of laryngectomy,
has told me that his patient had already (after a month) commenced
to speak again, though as yet only in a monotonous whispering voice.
She is doing so in spite of the fact that every vestige of her larynx,
which had been in a diseased state, and which the doctor showed me,
had been removed. When I told the doctor this mysterious "new"
voice was that of the &#339;sophagus and had always existed with his
patient, as it exists with every one else, and had always been heard
in conjunction with that of the trachea, he was greatly astonished,
though naturally incredulous, but said he would investigate.</p></div>


<h3>SONG, SINGERS, AND PHYSIOLOGY</h3>

<p>We are incomprehensible and mysterious beings.
We do not know whence we come nor whither we go;
we do not know what agencies guide and sustain us&mdash;our
end is a tragic one. While the soles of our feet
closely adhere to the ground, our heads are in touch
with the most distant stars. We exercise faculties
to perfection whose origin and mode of operation are
unalterably hidden from our knowledge. We possess
gifts and talents which raise us above the plane
of our ordinary existence and inspire us with the
belief that we are related to the divinity, are part of
the divinity. It has ever been man's aim to pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>trate
this darkness, to learn to comprehend <em>himself</em>.
The vocation of the singer is one to which this knowledge
is indispensable. In the fulness of his organization
endowed by nature with a divine gift, the
singer's aim and desire is to retain and perfect this
gift.</p>

<p>The birds sing their same individual song throughout
their career. Man, however, sings the song of
his soul; a song as endless and as varied as his
thoughts. Song with him is not a gift alone, but
its exercise is a study, an art. He must sing <em>knowingly</em>;
he must ascertain the source of his song and
the reason why certain causes produce certain results.
Hence the necessity for a science of the
voice.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the exercise of our faculties is
dependent on the knowledge of life and on that of the
spirit, without whose aid no transaction of life of any
kind ever takes place. Despairing of his ability to
penetrate into the realms of the spirit, aspiring man
has ever resorted to that which was next at his command&mdash;matter.
Hence the effort throughout all of
man's history to reach the soul by way of the body.
But body and mind, in alliance, have ever succeeded
in frustrating these efforts; in keeping the secret of
their duality and mutuality intact from the gaze of
man. Yet singers are determined to find out <em>something</em>
in relation to the <em>voice</em> at least. Finding
that we cannot penetrate into the relation existing
between mind and matter, the effort is renewed
in the most persistent manner to explain the life
and the spirit, whose essence and outcome is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
voice, by examining into the relation of matter to
matter.</p>

<p>Our professor, having discarded the assistance of
life and the spirit, dabbles in matter pure and undefiled.
This process our young students are invited
to attend. They carry their youth and their talent,
their high hopes and aspirations, into the dissecting-room,
where the spirit of the voice is supposed to
reveal itself among the ghastliest spectacles. If a
person of ordinary good sense, but not acquainted
with these subjects, were to attend a lecture on the
physiology of the voice and then attend a singing-lesson
based upon the knowledge thus attained, he
would be apt to remark: "Can this performance
possibly be meant to be in good faith? Is not
this man taking advantage of the credulity of this
woman, who is giving him her hard-earned money,
but to find before long that she has been beggared,
not only in purse, but in voice and spirit as well;
that she has not been benefited in any sense, but
sadly robbed and betrayed?"</p>

<p>The persistency with which the modern scientist
attempts to hammer a voice out of the larynx and
surrounding material tissues and other physical
agencies is a cardinal sin against the holy "spirit."
When he uses this supposed knowledge for coining
it into money at the expense of trusting and aspiring
singers, he commits a malpractice, for which
some day he will have to go to the penitentiary of
his own conscience; that is, if he is in possession of
any. "Vocal bands, mucous membranes, tissues,
ligaments, muscles, hollow spaces, air-pressure,"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>these
are the factors productive of the voice divine;
matter, nought but matter; not a spark of the divine
afflatus, not a spark even of life.</p>

<p>Journals devoted to the voice are full of these
things. I will quote but a single instance. At the
Music Teachers' National Convention, held in New
York, in June, 1898, a sensation was created by Dr.
Frank E. Miller (see <cite>Werner's Magazine</cite> for August,
1898, page 490) saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In other words, I wish to say that the action of the
cavities or hollow spaces is anterior and prior to the
action of the vocal bands in production of tone and
tone-quality in our organs of speech. <em>With this novel
fact I announce an original discovery.</em>"</p></div>

<p>It is such <em>stuff</em> as this that these people feed upon
and believe in as revelations of great moment.
Yet Dr. Miller and his coadjutors might sit before
these cavities or hollow spaces till the end of
time, looking, observing, probing, measuring, weighing,
and determining their relation to the vocal bands
and vice versa, and not a vestige of the spirit of the
voice would ever make its appearance. The last
conundrum of this kind, and it has special reference
to my discoveries, is as follows: "May not the disturbance
of speech known as stammering or stuttering
be mainly a condition caused by the putting
out of gear of one air-chamber in its relationship to
other air-chambers, whereby the air-pressures during
the speech-act are at war with one another, resulting
in the well-known manifestations?" (<cite>Werner's Magazine</cite>
for September, 1898, page 59). Air-chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and air-pressures again. I protest against being
made <em>particeps criminis</em> in any such proceeding.</p>

<p>When we go back to the earliest recorded times
and find traces of an attempt at expression by means
of crude signs or figures impressed upon the clay,
we can see more of the potentiality of a science (or
a civilization) arising therefrom than we can from
the teachings of the laryngoscopists, who claim that
the voice can be evolved from the relations of various
forms of matter to one another, without even a
trace of the spirit accompanying them.</p>

<p>Not many years since audiences of intelligent persons
were invited to watch a dark tent in which two
men were so closely tied together (as it was supposed)
that they could not possibly move a limb.
From this tent noises would arise as of the dragging
of chains along the floor, bells ringing, etc., interposed
now and then by a chair being flung through
the air. All this was done by the "spirits." This
was a proceeding not unlike the one now going on
in the materialistic school in connection with the
spirit of the voice. There is no more likelihood of
the latter arising from the dark tent of the matter
they are investigating than of a real spirit appearing
in that other tent. The performance, besides, is
not as amusing, no chairs being flung, etc. The
audience is looking on gravely expectant, but all
remains forever monotonously, solemnly, ominously,
and cadaverously silent and resultless.</p>

<p>The <em>living</em> grain of corn a blind hen after much
scratching succeeds in digging out from beneath a
barn-yard floor bears a closer resemblance to life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
hence to the voice, than the relations a professor of
physiology scratches together out of the various
parts which he supposes make up the instrument of
the voice. These attempts are so contrary to reason
and common sense that in any other science their
originators would be laughed to scorn for their
pains.</p>

<p>The other great issue with physiologists in connection
with the voice is that of breathing. Clavicular
breathing, costal breathing, diaphragmatic
breathing, etc.&mdash;these are some of the terms in
common use, and the "modes" of breathing commonly
practised. Each of these modes is supposed
to be practised separately and at the will of the
performer. They are praised and recommended or
condemned according to the special view of the
practitioner. Systems are based on these special
modes and schools arise therefrom. What one
"school" practises is condemned by another. And
how could it be otherwise, <em>all</em> being wrong?</p>

<p>Being homogeneous entities, whose wholesome
existence is based upon a harmonious co&ouml;peration of
all parts, we cannot practise breathing from a special
part without every other part more or less participating.
The act of breathing being our most vital performance,
every other part would suffer if it were
confined to any special part. Our entire system,
therefore, must participate therein; the hemisphere
of the abdomen no less than that of the thorax; both
hemispheres co&ouml;perating with each other and with
other streams introduced into our system through
the pores and every other opening in the body. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
a moment, and for an especial expression, one part
may prevail over another; but the true artist will
always breathe in such a manner that after such an
effort all parts will again harmonize and balance one
another. He will have such control over his breathing
powers that he can at any time throw the balance
of power into one direction; but he will never let
any one direction <em>continue</em> to prevail over any other.</p>

<p>Every theory heretofore advanced in respect to
our mode of breathing, being based upon false premises,
is wrong in the abstract, and impossible of
practical execution.</p>

<p>If I have expressed myself strongly, it is because
I feel strongly the injury which has been wrought
by this so-called "science" of the laryngoscopists.
It has in thousands of instances hindered the natural
development of the voice, and has in many other
directions done incalculable harm; while it has in
<em>no</em> direction ever done any good. It has oppressed
the intellect, depressed the spirit, and suppressed the
soul of singers. Let me add but this: What would
be the use of the most scientifically constructed
stove, filled with the most appropriate fuel, if the
flame were wanting to set fire to this fuel? Supposing
the laryngoscopists to comprehend the intricate
construction of the stove (the body), the
highly sensitive and complicated apparatus of the
fuel (the instrument of the voice)&mdash;both of which,
however, they are greatly in the dark about&mdash;the
flame would still be wanting to set fire to this fuel
and fill the stove with the holy glow of song. This
flame (the life, the spirit) they do not even pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
to be able to furnish. They only give us the stove
and the fuel, which remain forever dark, cold, lifeless,
inert.</p>

<p>To set myself up in judgment regarding these
important issues, or to place my judgment over
that of so many eminent persons in the past as well
as the present, may appear to be a presumptuous,
rash, bold, and almost unwarranted undertaking.
It is not my fault, however, that there should be
such utter confusion existing in these matters; that
no one should have ever succeeded in reducing this
chaos to any kind of order; that I am the heir, so
to say, to this condition of affairs; the trustee to
this inheritance, who is to make use of it to the best
advantage of all that are interested.</p>

<p>Nor is it my fault that, not by dint of superior endowments,
or any other qualities of a superior order,
but simply through the discovery of the dual nature
of the voice, I should have obtained an insight
into, a mastery over, these matters never before enjoyed
by any man. Yet there seems to be a disposition
on the part of some persons to throw blame
on me for these facts; in place of furthering, to
suppress, this knowledge; in place of probing and
investigating, to assume that it is simply the outcome
of a somewhat more than lively imagination.
It appears to me that this is partly done in the interest
of the vast literature on these subjects now in
existence, which will become obsolete and valueless
as soon as the <em>truth</em> in matters of the voice has been
established.</p>

<p>I dare say this simple fact, "We breathe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
speak through the &#339;sophagus in conjunction with
breathing and speaking through the trachea," for
<em>real</em> knowledge, is worth all of the entire literature
on the voice, as a science, now in existence.</p>

<p>The science of the voice, as I understand and am
trying to explain and establish it, is one not so
much of mechanical issues, though they have their
share in it, as one in which the spirit, this heretofore
unapproachable issue, performs the greatest and
most vital part. It is a question of life, and every
issue and every agency governing life are involved
in it. How vast a science this science of the voice
therefore is, can be better imagined than at once
fully comprehended. I am far from being able to
present it in all its aspects, but shall endeavor, as I
have already partly done, to continue to give a
general outline of it.</p>

<p>It will take time and patience for any one to acquire
this knowledge, but the reward will be more than
commensurate. To superficially obtain it from others
is not sufficient; one must learn to know it of one's
own knowledge. It is an academic study, embracing
many sciences. A person must enter into it with
his whole being if he wants to get hold of the spirit
thereof and be truly benefited thereby. He must
identify himself with this knowledge, must become
part and parcel thereof, or it must become part and
parcel of him. When this is done, true teachers of
the voice will arise, for here is a chance for greatness
to assert itself. It will be death to all hackneyed
knowledge and charlatanism.</p>

<p>When the true knowledge of the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
speech and song for <em>every</em> language has been established,
when we have a real science of the voice, the
teacher comprehending these issues in their entire
latitude will be able to teach how to interpret
Mozart, Schubert, and Wagner, Rossini and Verdi,
Gounod, and every other master in the tongue and
the spirit in which he has produced his works.</p>

<p>The genius for execution in the art of singing is
with the Anglo-Saxon race, but not for composition,
for original conception. It may come, but it is not
with it now.</p>

<p>The desire of the singer naturally is to embrace
the highest in her or his repertoire. At present it is
Wagner. But how can Wagner be rendered without
a comprehension of his genius as expressed through
his language? The genius of the master and the
genius of the language he wrote and composed in
cannot be separated. They are soul and body of
one and the same entity. Without the comprehension
of the genius of the German language, of its
idiomatic expression, it is not possible to reproduce
what Wagner meant to express by his work. To
sing German with an English tongue is an anomaly;
it is still English in the real sense of the word, and
not German. It is an unnatural proceeding, and
therefore injurious to the vocal organs of the singer.</p>

<p>No one would expect a foreigner, for the delectation
of a native-born audience, to recite before it
poetry in the latter's language, or a native-born
person to recite before it in a foreign tongue. In
either case such a person would fail. Why, then,
song, this sister art and accomplishment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>All these are questions which, though ever so
reluctantly, artists will have to face. It complicates
their art, but it will also, when understood, make it
comparatively easy. Americans will then sing the
works of foreign masters with the same perfect ease
that they do those of their native composers, and so
will persons of every other nationality.</p>

<p>Who will be able to teach a foreign language so
well as the natives of each respective country? provided
such persons have learned to comprehend the
difference between the mode of production of their
speech and that of their scholars. In that case only
will a German be able to teach an Anglo-Saxon his
(the German) language for either speech or song.
It will be the same with every other nationality.</p>

<p>The teachers, as a class, are with me. They feel
that the efforts of the physiologists to aid them in
their vocation are wrong and misleading. They
have no faith in the revelation of matter. They
know matter is inert, powerless for any purpose
without the indwelling of the spirit; that the spirit
reigns over and controls <em>every</em> manifestation of life;
and that the voice in singing is one of the highest
manifestations thereof. They know that song comes
from the heart and the soul, while it uses the body
for its instrument.</p>

<p>I have been told I must build up before tearing
down; before destroying the old I must put something
better in its place. I think it a praiseworthy
undertaking, in itself, to destroy the false and the
harmful. Besides, we cannot erect a new building
before the old one has been removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>As for this <em>new</em> science, I am doing what I can to
put it into shape, to give a visible and tangible form
to it as it has developed in my mind. The world
has been able to do without it so long, those interested
in these matters must have a little patience.</p>

<p>I specially appeal to the <em>young</em> to devote themselves
to these studies and to thus become the precursors
in the application of principles which are
destined to revolutionize the vocal science of the
world; the old being often too old to get out of
lifelong practices, no matter how erroneous. I appeal
in like manner to the students of medicine, and
to those of every other branch of science, whose aim
is the knowledge of man in any of, and all, his
relations.</p>
